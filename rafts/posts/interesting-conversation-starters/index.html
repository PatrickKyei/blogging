<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Striking and maintaining an interesting conversation is not always simple and easy for many. In an age where we love to express ourselves with emojis and memes, people are losing the skill of expressing themselves through valuable conversations. An age where you click a button to express you like someone or something - an age where you can express your dislike or hate for something with the click of a button, people are growing into the habit of ending it there when they say just a word. They lose the opportunity of knowing and experiencing what maintaining a valuable conversation can lead one to.</p>

<p>It almost looks like we want to say more but don’t know how.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our words are trapped within our heads.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We delete our emotions and expressions, end them with a simple “I’m fine” and walk away. We cry for affection and connection but don’t know how to establish and maintain one ourselves.</p>

<p>People are falling into the habit of getting stuck after “how are you”, “what did you eat”, “how’s work”. There’s a lot of fun and interesting conversations that can be had if one can move past some of these basic questions.</p>

<h2 id="build-a-stronger-communication-system">Build A Stronger Communication System</h2>

<p>You have to build a strong communication system which portrays your warm and sincere values. When you show genuine interest in people, it moves them to want to have a deeper connection with you. This sounds great but might seem like a lot of work for some people. Especially if after your two-three greetings and questions there seems to be nothing more to talk about. Sometimes it is nice to have both of you in a duo and really say nothing, the idea or sense that the other person is on the other end is fulfilling enough - this works if there is an already strong connection between the two parties. If you are starting out, you need to say something interesting to build the connection, otherwise you come off as boring and uninteresting. And you miss out on a relationship that could have been so wonderful.</p>

<p>So what should you say? Where must you start from? How do you know when to switch the topic to something more crazy?</p>

<p>These are many questions we might have asked ourselves already.</p>

<h2 id="starting-out">Starting Out</h2>

<p>You can control the human interaction if you’re intentional about your communications in this way. You think about what you want to say. You think about the emotions you want to project. And you bridge the undeniable differences among humans by the clarity of your emotions. That’s what holds your listener.</p>

<p>If you show up half-present, conflicted, nervous, distracted, or with something else on your mind, you won’t hold the attention of your listener. But if you know what you’re doing, you can take charge of your listener’s brain and get it to match yours.</p>

<p>People often want to come out as nice the first time you meet or approach them; only a few are rude the first time. Many times, how you go out is how you are received. If you tend to be friendly, you get a friendly response. If you present yourself as boring or uninteresting, you get same response.</p>

<p>You also have to care and be enthusiastic when meeting new people. If you are genuine in forming relationships and show that you are eager to learn, then networking can open doors to valuable opportunities down the line.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-first-connection">Creating the first Connection</h2>

<p>A lot of the time a simple hello bridges the gap in communication. The first time you want to connect to someone, say hello and introduce yourself. This can be a really quick and short intro. You don’t wanna go on for so long and break the first attention you had. So if you met the person at the bank, you can come on as; “Hello my name is Patrick. I’m also here to deposit some cash at the bank. Have you been waiting here for long?” In this situation you’ve been able to introduce yourself to the person, making it more easier to open up to you. You also created an opportunity for them to speak if they weren’t so willing to talk by asking the question, “have you been waiting for long.” You can then take charge of the conversation here.</p>

<p>In other cases it could be a compliment on something they are wearing or a nice gesture they made. For example, “I really like your dress. The color is very nice. I like dresses with that color. Did you choose it yourself?” There are many ways you can get to someone in the moment and quickly create a connection by creating a shared experience.</p>

<p>After been able to establish the connection, the next thing is to find the best way to keep in touch with them. And this is by taking down their contact information. Pls don’t do all these and fail to take down their contact information. Because when they leave, that might be the last time to see them. If you like the person, find a nice way to take down their number. This part might seem tricky since you don’t want to come off as too strong. But it can be very easy, especially if they enjoyed the short moment with you. They might already be anticipating this next move. So be that bold and make the move.</p>

<p>You can ask for example; “It was very nice meeting you. What is the best to keep in touch with you?” They might tell you or even give you their contact information themselves. If you realize this is not happening quickly, you can go on by saying, “I think I will take down your number so we can still be in touch. What is your number?”, whiles you pull your phone out.</p>

<h2 id="after-hello-what-next">After “Hello” What Next?</h2>

<p><img data-proofer-ignore data-src="/assets/img/conversation-starters-what-next.png" alt="what-next" /></p>

<p>If you are lucky, you are able to get the contact the first time you engaged. How do you continue to engage with this person in an interesting way to even warrant the next meeting if you make the request? Because if you are not interesting enough you are going to be let down with a no as an answer if you ask to see them again. If  it only becomes “hello how are you”, “what did you eat”, “how is your family and work” all the time it is going to be boring and the communication is going to die.</p>

<p>Mostly they are not going to reach out to you and it is going to seem you are the only one doing all the work. And oh yes you will be doing all the work at first but when you are interesting  or make your conversations interesting enough, they will reach out to you themselves. So how can you spice up things better? You can! This is where I am going to list a number of interesting topics and questions you can chip in your conversation. It is going to bring up a lot of things to talk about and you may even have the chance to know each other better. In this case don’t let it be only a question to the other person. If they provide an answer to the things you ask, you may provide your opinion on it to make it more spontaneous. The next you will realize is they coming out to ask your opinions on the subsequent interactions - keeping the conversation lively and fun.</p>
