Birds learn to fly by flying.Children learn to walk by walking.The brain build connections and expands through intensive activities.Don’t fight with reality, flow with it.Let’s break this downI spent part of my life living close to the countryside. This was in my early years growing up.We used to go bird hunting with other kids in the neighborhood just to explore around.When we get to the bed nest, we disturb the nest for the mother bird to fly away so that we can catch the younger birds home for our entertainment.Usually after 4 to 7 days, the little birds would have started to learn how to fly. By day 10 they would have learnt to fly away if you were not careful when you were playing with them.That simple aspect of the baby birds life often kept me thinking a lot. I always wanted to understand how the bird could learn how to fly without anybody teaching it how to fly and especially when the mother was not with it.You need limits to find yourselfYour brain thrives on intensive activities.Each problem you solve in your life sparks neural connections.Learning isn’t passive activity. It’s an active, dynamic process that builds patterns in your brain through repetition and experience.Birds don’t sit in a nest reading flight manuals. They leap, flap, and sometimes fail.All the periods we spent throwing the baby birds up and down playing with them were times they were practicing their flight moves.The same goes for children learning to walk. They stumble, fall, and get back up, each attempt strengthening their ability.Learning to walk is a very difficult milestone to cross by children but you are doing it so effortlessly now because your brain has mastered the skill and has solved the walking pattern for you and so you don’t consider it as a big task anymore.What you think you are doing now is putting one foot in front of the other. But it is more complex than you think about it.The fundamental ingredient for your overall growth is self education. This is the foundation of your growth.Ask yourself, how did you learn how to walk?You learn how to walk by taking some few steps, stumbling, falling, getting up and walking again. You learnt how to talk by cooing, bubbling, making ineligible sounds until you learnt to talk.Start before you are readyWhen you want to learn anything, it is common to want to read about the topic through or watch videos about it throughout.This actually hurts you. Because for example, if you want to learn design, you’ll go to YoutuTube and binge watch videos about the topic before you decide to start.After you start you realize that you’ve forgotten all that you learnt and have to go back and watch again. This is called tutorial hell.Study the principlesI am building a new website.I mentioned this in one of the previous Letters, I think in the last two Letters.Principles are important. I have some background in web design. But I am using a new css frameworks I have not worked with before to build my new website.Instead of going to YouTube first to watch videos about how to use the framework, I am going about it in a whole new way.I am starting with the project, building the website and looking at the documentation, or watching a YouTube tutorial to solve a specific problem I encounter during the project.You begin to appreciate the depth of what you are learning when you have a project you can apply what you are learning to - building stuff.If you are thinking about a small project you want to build in real life and apply your experience to then enroll in the 7 Days Value Creator Writing Challenge where you will learn how to: Start an online business, Grow your customer base, Make tons of money in the process.Start before you know how.Think about it. The best way to learn how to swim isn’t by reading every book on swimming technique—you jump into the pool and paddle around until you figure it out.The same goes for anything else you want to master. Whether it’s starting a business, learning a new skill, or pursuing a passion project, the most effective approach is to dive right in and learn as you go.Stop complaining about your lack of results.Complain about your lack of action.Stop debating, planning, and putting things onhold. Write the book Launch the podcast Start building online Start the side hustle Build an inbound business Build multiple income streams Start the company you always wanted Build your personal brand and become thego-to in your industryStop putting yourself down.You don’t have to be an expert or have it allfigured out.It’s you vs you.Fighting against reality—against the natural way of learning—only holds you back. Embrace the process. Dive into action. Make mistakes, learn, and grow. This is how you truly advance.Teach others, help othersThe interesting thing about helping others reach the stage that you have reached (whether it’s free or paid), you are forced to organize the information and make connections.You HAVE to struggle with organizing information (or ordering consciousness) to pass along to others.The teacher learns more than the student.This will open up room to reach your next developmental stage faster.When you have everything you’ve made sense of packaged up and hosted in the digital world — you don’t have to worry about it anymore. You get to build on top of it. Iteration.By doing this consistently over a 2-3 year span, you will bust through new stages of development, help others get there, and gain a deep satisfaction for life in general.There are people who are doing way better than you right now.The shocking thing is that, these people do not know half of what you know, yet they’re doing better than you.You’ve been stuck in the loop of trying to become an expert before even taking the first step.If you consume too much and don’t use it to build, your mind gets fat.Thanks for reading. Talk soon.What’s upYou might read the online version of this Letter from a new website.It wouldn’t be in it’s perfect state. I will continue to iterate and add features.I will virtually be building this website with you guys.Check it out and email me what feature you think I should add next and where I should be making improvementsThere are new resources as well. Do check them out.I started a YouTube version of the Letters but stopped. I am putting resources together to resume.

Thoughts, regrets and tasks are the program slowing your performance. Learn, build, expand to focus your mind.If you do not improve your mind, you cannot improve your life.To change your life, first what controls your actions and behaviors.There are quite a few things we have mentioned already.Read on to discover the rest.3. Seek mentorsWe are no longer limited by geographical boundaries when it comes to connecting and keeping in touch with people around us and even those on different continents.Change starts from the mind.If you believe you can’t do something you will never be able to do it.However, if someone showed you how it’s possible because they did it, you are set free from that mental prison.So what you want to do is find online mentors.My progress significantly boosted when I found the right online mentor to guide and push me when the motivation oil evaporates.People that introduce you to new ways of thinking and new ways of seeing life are so important.First, they tell you what to do but second of all the main benefit is you now know what not to do.So much effort and energy is wasted in the beginning by questioning yourself.“Am I doing the right thing?”, “should I do this or should I do that”, “should I do it in this way or should I do it in that way”.A Mentor helps you ‘focus’ and that can completely change the game.4. Solve your own problemsYes we mentioned a Mentor. It is important to have a Mentor. However a Mentor is not going to solve your problems for you.They may be able to give you a roadmap that will help you. The actual responsibility is on you. Your life is your responsibility.Gain actual experience by solving your own problems. Hit limits. Learn. Push through.You need challenges to find your limits.You need limits to find yourself.We set goals to knock problems off in our lives.So identify a goal in your life. Like quitting your job, finding a partner or getting fit.Start with what you know. You can only know what to learn when you hit a roadblock.So hit one fast and pursue your curiosity. Let your experience guide you into new areas of your life to experiment.5. Prove yourself to yourselfProve yourself to yourself.Nobody cares about you.No one believes anything you have to say until you prove that your words have weight.Work hard to give life to your words.Actualize your words and become reliable.Proving yourself to yourself improves your mind and builds your mental mastery.When you prove yourself to yourself, you gain: Confidence: Knowing you can follow through on your promises builds self-assurance. Respect: People respect those who back up their words with actions. Reliability: Becoming someone who delivers on commitments makes you a dependable force.Don’t rely on outside validation. Show yourself what you’re capable of. Once you see it, others will see it.Master your mind, and you’ll master your world.6. Ditch friends who slow down your progressFor the past 5 years I have managed to tighten my circle of friends.I have identified certain people I don’t want them in my circle of friends. I stayed off their tracks.I am not saying treat people poorly. It would be good for you to keep certain people at arms length and help them when you can.Limiting beliefs are contagious. If you hold them, it’s often because those around you do as well.Society today restricts your potential by overly socializing you. Constantly engaging with others’ opinions—whether on your phone, social media, or in person—leaves little time for solitude. However, as Naval Ravikant said, “Greatness is built in solitude.”To become truly exceptional, you need space, solitude, and loneliness foster discipline and mastery.Success demands obsessive focus, which is hindered by frequent social engagements and distractions.7. Invest in yourselfYou suck.The reason you aren’t getting results in your business, the reason you aren’t making money online, the reason you aren’t making headway in your relationships is because you suck.You aren’t good enough. You haven’t put in the thousands of hours of improvement necessary to get good enough.On a global scale, there is a lot of quantity. You can’t stand out by making stuff; you stand out by making great stuff.Here’s the truth: You’re not putting in the work. You’re not improving daily. You’re not learning from your mistakes.Quantity is everywhere. Quality is rare.To stand out, you need to: Commit to relentless improvement. Invest thousands of hours to master your craft. Focus on creating great work, not just more work.Stop making excuses. Start putting in the effort.Greatness is built over time. It’s earned through dedication and hard work.You have the potential. Now, put in the hours to make it happen.8. CollaborateYou can get anything done if you do not care who gets the credit. Mastermind Network Ask for help Get a mentor Model someone who is where you aspire to beCollaborate!A simple piece of advice can: Build you a huge audience Launch your product Make you millions Change your life foreverStop worrying about who gets the glory. Focus on getting things done. Share the spotlight, learn from others, and watch your success skyrocket.I hope this helps.

The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. —Michio KakuI spend most of my time around computers and I am fascinated by the amount of power they have.A whole company the size of New York city can be run and managed by a single computer connected to the cloud.If your brain, your mind is the powerhouse of your productivity why haven’t taken absolute control of it?With the advent of the internet and social media, your brain is always connected to massive pool of information.But instead of leveraging your access to the internet to nourish your mind, power your brain for it to run your life efficiently, you spend your time just scrolling online to numb your mind.You must keep your mind in regular active activities that improves your overall life.Computers undergo regular software updates to run efficiently. The same thing can be said about the human brain. “You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength “ - Marcus AureliusSeek knowledge that improves lifeYou need proper information to think properly and to think as a human. Or you will behave at the basic instinct or superstition level. Work on your mind. If your life sucks try educate yourself. If you feel you are not making any progress educate yourself. If your mind is clogged and your perspectivelooks blurred educate yourself. If you feel a limit on your mental ability andcreative potent educate yourself. The right mindset makes everything right.There’s something about knowledge.Once you continue to get knowledge you will never fail. You will see that you are making progress without even being aware.Years ago I got fed up with the progress I was making. So I decided to go on months of self improvement journey.I didn’t know exactly what I was doing but I love being challenged.I spent hours upon hours to learn new skills and build lots of projects.At first everything felt like a bunch of disconnected nonsense. But I kept on. I sat there, in front of my laptop - reading and building different kinds of projects with the intention to launch some of the them into businesses.I wasn’t successful and I failed at a lot of them. As painful as it was, this experience taught me some of the biggest lessons that I live by even today.I have a wealth of experience and practical case studies I can apply to my online businesses today.On that note I want to let you that we are opening a small window of beta users for the Value Creator Module of Skillembassy Digital Mastery Bootcamp in a challenge which starts on 21 July.There are limited slots so you should head over right now to save your spot.If you continue to feed your mind purge your mind renew your mind polish your thoughtsimprove yourself because knowledge is what builds your inner being, you’ll begin to operate on a higher frequency.Your emotions are weak because you have a weak mindset.Once you have strong knowledge your emotions will improve.You’ll have power over the resources that you are wasting.You’ll have control over the decisions that you have to make to change your life.You will be shocked how your overall life will improve.8 Truths to Build mental mastery1. Seek new informationWhen you buy a new computer it comes clean with only the basic software you need to access the computer interface.All the important software you need to work with is downloaded and customized by the user to their preference.When you are born you don’t know anything. You are as clean as a new computer with the basic senses to navigate the world.Your parents, friends, teachers and society download into your brain new softwares which shapes your identity.You are told to go school, get a job and retire Early in your 60’s.So chances are the actions you take will be made according to the information that you were exposed to. The beliefs that have been programmed into your mental software.The people around you and the things that you’ve been consuming are not going to make any progress in your life if you hold on to those beliefs.In fact they’ll be detrimental to your progress.So what you want to do is read vastly. Consume content and information that will challenge your beliefs and expose you to new ways of thinking.Most of your problems stem from mental limitations and blockages.If you want to master all areas of life, mental mastery must be at the top of your list.How do you do that?self-awareness,self-examination,self-determination.Where do you start from? Self-education.How do you start? Read books.2. Discover your true selfYou cannot discover who you are without friction.You need limits to find yourself.You discover who you are when you push through pain, doubt, the exhaustion of life—this is where you discover what you are made of.Gold is tested with burning furnace. Without friction, the push and the pull, you cannot get anything fine.Challenges strip away the excess, the noise, the excuses. They force you to confront your raw, unfiltered self.When you face your limits, you confront your fears, your weaknesses, and your insecurities.In that moment , you find clarity, strength, and a deeper understanding of who you are.When you reach the pinnacle, cross the finish line you’ll appreciate who you have become.Your resilience, your grit, your unyielding spirit will stick with you for life.To sum up:You need to hunt for new information to challenge your worldview.Your perspective shapes your reality.I will stamp this quote here so that you keep it at the back on your mind:“Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do.”Taking in so much information into your mind without applying it to build a personal project will cause mental obesity.It clogs your mind and shallow your creative potential.↓Read to learn.Build to apply.Distribute to expand.LearnBuildExpandKnowledge and willpower are important.Invest in a personal project and build a project that reflects your life’s work.If you want to be notified when the second part of this Letter is released subscribe to the Patrick Kyei Letters.i.

You can make acquaintances that will play a pivotal role in your life. You can make income that isn’t limited by a salary.We aren’t digging goldmines and coalmines like the 70’s. The masters of today hunt for ideas and information.In the digital economy, a personal brand is not a second option.Society continues to define what values is in every generation.Our ancestors dug deep down to the heart of mother earth for value. They traded gold, diamonds, ore and other minerals as exchange for value.Masters of the industrial age were those who had huge machinery.Wealth and riches which essentially leads to a good life was centralized among corporations.The Internet and social media has diversified wealth creation.I used to hate social media but honestly, it’s now part and parcel of my success.I got my first ‘real’ job when I posted the certificate I had completing my 6 month upskilling program.Social media is how you get a job without a job board, sell a book without a publisher, and make music without a record deal.Many people hear this and think it is impossible when all they do is scroll and consume all day, post random memes and argue with faces they don’t recognize online.They are not consistent and have no strategy but complain when they don’t see results.The big pictureEveryone has a digital avatar, whether you know it or not.If you have a social media account like Facebook, Twitter (X), Whatsapp or LinkedIn.It is your duty to build that avatar to represent who you are online. Like the avatar you build in a video game.At the basic level you have few upgrades. But as you progress you have access to more upgrades (resources ) to improve your performance (impact).When you get to higher levels you win more and get what you want faster.Social media facilitate exchange of value without the limit to location and time. You have to be within that environment to benefit from this.Nobody knows you.You have to make people aware of you.The easiest path is to build a digital avatar of you. A social media profile that can hold your physical character and value in the digital space.Start from hereCreate a Facebook account.Pick a social platform that doesn’t require you to know much technical skills, picture editing, video editing etc.Facebook is a text based platform with a huge user base so it is easier to grow on it.As you establish your presence, you can diversify your reach to other platforms by directing your followers there.So I recommend you create a Facebook account and start writing about: your story. your skills. your beliefs. your passion. your highs and lows. your mistakes and lessons. your ideas and observations.Creating content on social media is truly the simplest and most affordable way to market yourself in today’s internet age.Next week we can go deeper on how to grow your account.But first make I want to make sure you have an account on either Twitter or Facebook we can work with.If you already have an account great.Do a little bit of tidying up on your profile: get a quality headshot profile picture use Canva or Microsoft designer to get a simple banner create a concise headline about what you offer. Pick 3 to 4 topics you genuinely care about. I love talking about business, productivity, self mastery and branding. read books on these topics. Broaden your knowledge base, take notes so you can blend that with your personality.Social media is a big business.The apps on your phone are gateway to freedom. Don’t sleep on it.Everything you need to write and post on social media has been Simplified in my Value Creator Writing PlaybookOne high income skill you must learn this year is: how to be confident and comfortable sharing your story out there. how to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.Your skill set isn’t valuable if nobody knows about it.The Internet is a multiplierMost people still perceive social media as an “app on their phone.” And yet they spend much-too-large portion of their life on it.I want you to develop mindset about it.Once you see social media for what it is, a new world opens up. You can learn skills that schools can’t teach you. You can make acquaintances that will play a pivotal role in your life. You can make income that isn’t limited by a salaryI quit Facebook for a month, created a new account and used it to STUDY the platform.I did a lot of experimenting. If I want to grow very fast, I know what growth strategy to execute.Play the long game. Slow, study and consistent.Social media is a skill, not random luck.People always think it’s about luck or magic when they haven’t spent even one hour studying the skill.They scroll mindlessly, envying the success of others, assuming it’s all chance.But behind every viral post, every engaging story, there’s strategy, consistency, and a deep understanding of the platform.It’s about: Knowing your audience. Crafting compelling content. Timing your posts for maximum impact. Engaging with followers authentically.Those who succeed on social media have put in the hours.They’ve studied trends, analyzed data, and continuously refined their approach.Luck might give you a moment in the spotlight.But skill keeps you there.If you’re serious about leveraging social media, stop waiting for a miracle.If I am a business owner I’d rather have a 100K audience, with 10K of those being my target audience, than only a 10K audience of my target. More leverage, reach, and opportunity. It’s a numbers game.But you stack the deck in your favor by building competence. Because competence converts.Start investing time into learning the craft.Your followers, engagement, and success will grow as a direct result.Thanks for reading.

I felt it wasn’t any serious thing to trouble anyone about.It was until I grew up that I understood why this happens during one of our science class.Hold on a little with the plant thing for me.I will tell you why this question that I ignored years ago was so important and how it changed my life.And I believe you can learn from this too.Growth comes from letting goYou see during the dry season, plants face water scarcity and high temperatures. To survive these harsh conditions, plants shed their leaves through a process called abscission.I am going to plug this process to the human life. As all things of nature share certain commonalities, humans share this process with plants.Here’s what happens during this phase of your life:Drawing Parallels Between Plant Adaptation and Human Brain EvolutionJust as plants shed leaves to adapt and survive during the dry season, humans also go through adaptive processes throughout their lives. Here’s how each point about plant adaptation relates to how your mind goes through different changes: Water Conservation - Resource Management: Plants: Shed leaves to conserve water. Humans: Conserve resources (energy, time, focus) to adapt to changing environments. For example, during childhood, the brain prunes unnecessary neural connections to optimize learning and development. This is what makes children learn very quickly about their environment. Reduced Energy Demand - Efficiency in Growth: Plants: Drop leaves to reduce metabolic demands. Humans: Simplify and prioritize tasks during different life stages. In adulthood, people often focus on core responsibilities and skills that matter most for personal and professional growth, shedding extraneous activities. Protection Against Damage - Psychological Resilience: Plants: Avoid damage and infection by shedding leaves. Humans: Develop resilience and coping mechanisms to protect mental health. Over time, individuals learn to manage stress and avoid harmful situations, much like how plants avoid potential leaf damage. Cycle of Renewal - Lifelong Learning and Adaptation: Plants: Prepare for new growth when conditions improve. Humans: Continuously learn and evolve. Throughout life, humans adapt to new experiences, challenges, and knowledge, fostering personal growth and renewal. Now can you appreciate the intricate processes that underpin growth and survival in nature and human life.Here’s where things take a turnSome humans, unlike plants skip phase 4 of the mental life cycle.Society conditions you to think a certain way with beliefs and teachings to conform.This conditioning crystallizes in your brain and becomes part of your identity.You’d do everything to defend these beliefs if you feel they are threatened.We saw from the plants that in order for it to stand the chance of survival, it has to let go of some of it’s leaves and regrow new once it has passed the phase of the severe drought.The challenge with some people is that they continue to hold on to their old system of beliefs.They continue to apply old information to their current life.Life evolves and you have to evolve with it.Adopt a new mental module around businessWe are not building businesses like we did in the 2000’s.The first place to build a business in 2024 is online. Build distribution, then build whatever you want. – Jack Butcher If you will prune away your old mentality and adopt to the modern times, you’d see that starting a business in 2024 is the easiest you can do.Start as one person. Leverage the technology available to you. Years ago it wasn’t possible to do this but with the internet powering apps and the technology we use you can build anything if you have distribution. Write posts every single day that live on your profile. Network with people to get them shared (so you can grow without the algorithm). Start a YouTube channel or Instagram live to build authority Plug your newsletter so you own your audience. Give away free value to grow your audience. Sell a low-ticket product to have more people dedicated to your brand. With an audience of 10,000, newsletter of 1,000, and network of 100 – you can do anything you want. You have the resources to make a full time income at this point. Beyond that, you can funnel extra cash into building your dream company or investing. This letter was for big picture understanding. For practical steps, stay tuned for the subsequent Letters.Thank you for reading." }, { "title": "7 punclines that changed my life and might change yours", "url": "/posts/7-punchlines-that-changed-my-life-and-might-change-yours/", "categories": "Mindset, Lifestyle", "tags": "letters, growth, business", "date": "2024-06-01 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Ideas begets ideas.Ideas influence our perspective of life.Our perspective influences our pursuits in life.Today, I will share with you some ideas (punchlines) that have changed my life and that wi...", "content": "Ideas begets ideas.Ideas influence our perspective of life.Our perspective influences our pursuits in life.Today, I will share with you some ideas (punchlines) that have changed my life and that will probably change yours as well.Don’t miss the last quote.1. Learn to believe in yourself.No one else can do it for you.Self-belief is the foundation of all success.When you trust your own abilities, you unlock a world of possibilities.The single cause of change in my life has been self belief.Doubt holds you back; confidence pushes you forward.Think about the times you achieved something you thought was impossible.You did it because, deep down, you believed you could.So, silence the inner critic.Focus on your strengths.Celebrate your wins, no matter how small.Believe in your potential, and watch yourself rise to heights you never imagined.Self belief is vital for change in your life.2. Stop taking useless advice.Not all advice is good advice.Everyone has an opinion, but not everyone has experience.Filter out the noise.Listen to those who have been where you want to go.Value quality over quantity.Seek out mentors, not just critics.Apply advice that aligns with your goals.Test it, see if it works for you.Remember, you know your path better than anyone else.Trust your judgment.Be selective with the guidance you follow.Your time and energy are too valuable to waste on useless advice.3. Use your power.You have more strength than you realize.Stop doubting your abilities.Take control of your actions.Harness your potential.Set clear goals.Take decisive steps towards them.Don’t wait for permission.Act with confidence.Face challenges head-on.Embrace your unique strengths.You are capable of more than you think.Use your power to create the life you want.4. Don’t think too much.Stop overthinking and just start.That’s the simple yet powerful advice you need when faced with the daunting question of “How do I start?”Too often, we use this question as a procrastination tactic, a way to delay taking action until we feel fully prepared or have all the answers. But the truth is, you’ll never feel completely ready, and there will always be unknowns along the way.So instead of getting bogged down in analysis paralysis, take that first step. Dive in headfirst and start making progress, even if you’re not entirely sure where to begin.Sure, you’ll hit roadblocks along the way. That’s inevitable. But each obstacle you encounter is an opportunity to learn and grow. Educate yourself, seek out solutions, and be willing to experiment and adapt as you go.And when you do encounter challenges, don’t immediately turn to others for advice. Trust yourself to find a way forward.

It is transformational when someone teaches you how to be purposeful about your thoughts, how to take charge of your life and your brain.Most economics and social scientists would agree that the world is changing around us.We are in the midst of an economic revolution that will radically alter our society in the same way that the industrial and agricultural revolutions did.The issue with situations like these is that they are difficult for a number of people to understand the dynamics of the changing times.They continue to hold on the old ways of getting results which is often difficult to break in in the modern era.If you go back a hundred years and look at diaries from the industrial revolution, you’ll see people freaking out about how the world is changing and feeling utterly unsure.What Question Do You Ask Yourself?And at the heart of these shifts are generally disputes about the meaning of productivity.Is it more productive for me to just generate reminders, or is it more effective for me to think and come up with a fantastic idea? Is it more productive for me to spend time with my family and be happy?A debate about productivity is taking place now in a way that our parents and grandparents did not have to deal with.And it’s quite fine for you to be concerned about it.You should not feel terrible about your anxiety. It’s merely a feature of the time, but there is a solution.The solution is to figure out how to drive yourself to think more, to focus on the right goals, to goals that align with your interests, to become an innovation broker, and to construct mental models so you can focus better.Going Headfirst At The ProblemFor the first time, we have a good enough understanding of how the brain works to be able to control our thoughts and become more effective.Teaching yourself to think more helps to alleviate anxiety. Because once you have power over your thoughts, there is nothing you can’t accomplish.You can join Skillembassy or if you are facbook where we dig for principles to become a better thinker and performerMaking a decision that gives you a sense of control makes it much simpler to engage the areas of your brain that govern motivation, which works extremely well for little activities.Making Your Thought Process More IntentionalI believe there is a basic lesson here, which is that we are living in a time of rapid change and it is all too easy to become so distracted that you stop being productive.And you might get so preoccupied that you lose the ability to focus on what is truly essential.When we say that understanding how to think is just as important as knowing what to think about, we’re talking about lessons on how to structure our thinking and create routines that help us to stay focused on the most important things. Routines that we build essentially give us the space to think about the right things.The thing that differentiates the most productive people from everyone else is that they have these routines that force them to think about what’s happening a little bit more.So, in addition to every morning, one of my major contemplative habits is to write down my thinking process, record thoughts that come to me, and subsequently put it somewhere I can see it and think about it a little bit more. I’ve discovered that writing down my thoughts helps me comprehend why I have that idea; it forces me to think a little more thoroughly, such as, “why did I believe this method was right?” And while they might be difficult at times, they have proven to be the most significant.The Common Difficult DesireYou know, one of the major difficulties in modern life is that we all want to think more, right?Nobody says, “I wish I was thinking less about the important things each day,” but one of the problems is that we frequently get so caught up that we forget to think.Not because we don’t like the idea of thinking, but because there are always a thousand items on your to-do list before you can think about what is happening in the moment at or your priorities. Many times, we learn things but do not retain them.It is difficult to see that the most productive people have this type of check-in mechanism.Where they will regularly set aside two hours on certain days and say, “For these two hours, I’m going to look at what occurred in the past week and I’m going to plan the future week,” or they will have a regular lunch once every three weeks with one of their greatest friends.My 7 Days Business Challenge forces you to think and focus on the most important things in your life towards your financial freedom.And during that dinner, they always do the same thing: they speak about what happened in the past three weeks, the finest ideas they’ve been exposed to, and they explain those ideas.Then they talk about what they’re looking forward to in the following three weeks.We conceive of those as things we do in our social freedom, right? That we share ideas with our friends in order to educate them.But what’s really going on is that we’re educating ourselves. We’re recalling the most important ideas.We’re rephrasing that concept in such a manner that it pushes us to make sense of it, to understand how it connects with our lives and how we might apply it.Take-AwayPeople who understand the repercussions of their acts, who understand how to control their own thoughts and actions, are the ones who participate in these meditative routines the most.They have routines — habits that drive them to consider what is truly going on.And it’s a strategy that pays off in the long term.Thanks for reading." }, { "title": "optimize your life", "url": "/posts/optimize-your-life/", "categories": "Personal Growth, Business", "tags": "letters, growth, business", "date": "2024-05-18 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Anything that you optimize makes maximum use of available resources.Memory and space have a finite lifespan.The engineers of this world knows this.

Your Life.Your life’s work should be your no.1 goal.What you’ll spend most of your time on is improving your life to achieve happiness.All of the inter-working processes you will go through to achieve this is going to be determined by your brain.The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. — Michio KakuYou have the world’s most powerful super computer in your head.You can improve your life if you improve your brain.The problems is that most people have old mental software.You need to update your mental software from “Get a job and do that for the rest of my life” as a default setting to: Get a job start a personal project turn that project into a business make enough money, leave my job and focus on scaling my side hustle as the new pathYou see, everyone needs money.The easiest way? Get a job.And 9-5 jobs aren’t bad.I worked for years as an employee to gain skills.I learned persuasion, sales, human psychology, communication and collaboration.However, it’s not optimal.You might be earning a profit, but:You’re not following your purpose by working a job you hate.You’re not free if your boss calls you at night, telling you to show up tomorrow on your day off. If you say no, you lose your job.You don’t have time to enjoy life.Spend time with family because you’re required to work like an animal.You start smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol to “get rid of” the stress.OPEN YOUR MIND TO INFORMATIONDuring the past 2 days my computer had been having glitches due to low storage capacity.Shockingly the system upgraded itself, removed certain folders and files for it to run smoothly.To me this was painful. But it was a necessary requirement for the system to run efficiently.Up until you turned 18 years you have been conditioned to think and live a certain way by parents, teachers, friends and whatever.You were sold the safe path: go to college get good grades find a decent job retire at 60 and wait for deathSo what you choose to spend the rest of your life on has been limited by society. You were sold an illusion by parents and teachers who were sold an illusion.People are starting to wake up to the fact that the conventional path doesn’t work for smart people.The internet has made it possible to monetize the knowledge in your head. People who know how to learn, build, and distribute information will thrive.If you are reading to this point I assume you are smart to notice this.LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLEIf you don’t know what you want, understand what you don’t want and work in the opposite direction.It is easy to observe what you don’t want and reverse engineer your path .Set a 10 years goals. Break it down into stage and work it back.What you want in 10 years, 5 years, 1 year, 6 months, weeks, days to achieve those goals.We are in an information age — there is information and an abundance of ideas circulating our world.People are losing trust in externally assigned hierarchies of goals whether it be from corporate culture, organized religions, or formal education.Because of this, you must play an active role in constructing your life. This requires personal responsibility, massive self-belief, and the realization that your life’s work if your no.1 goal, not work assigned to you.FILTER THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOUNot all information available to you will be useful to achieve your goals.Filter every information through your 10 year vision.Say “no” to everything except for that which aligns with the new person you want to become.Start optimizing the buggy mental conditioning of your mind through conscious choice.Everybody has heard of James Clear’s “One Percent Better Everyday” mantra.It holds a lot of power.If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom.If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear.If you’re spending too much time on video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.It took 18+ years to condition you to the point you are now.Don’t expect much progress overnight.Surround yourself with people who inspire you to think bigger, aim higher and relentlessly go after it.Self-educate to expand awareness and uncover new paths.Hypothesize and experiment with solutions that will solve your problems.Most people allow their life to simply happen to them. They float along. They wait. They react. And by the time a large portion of their life is behind them, they realize they should have been more proactive and strategic.I hope that hasn’t been true for you. If it has, then I want to encourage you to adopt the new path and leave the conventional path. It served it’s purpose, it will no longer serve you.OPTIMIZE YOUR LIFE FOR THE NEW PATHBuild a personal brandTo make any kind of money in today’s internet world, you must deliver substantial value, build a brand that people trust and associate who you are becoming with.Why are most digital products not making the profit?Why are most service businesses not succeeding?It’s because they lack a strong brand behind them.There’s no trust, connection, and empathy.If you’re unsure where to begin or need ideas on how to start building your personal brand I teach this in the 7 Days Business ChallengeFind a NicheWhen you have a skill, you need to identify a niche to apply it to.Fitness coaches?Real estate agents?Software companies?Cleaning businesses?Determine who your service is for.Alternatively, you can choose the second option, which I did, and go broad.If you’re planning to write sales copy (become a copywriter), I would suggest finding a targeted niche.If you have any questions, you can always send me a DM or reply to this mail. I’ll be happy to help.Post Valuable Contents DailyYour focus now should just be on building your brand and learning the skill you’ve picked.If it’s copywriting, practice the skill by writing content daily.If it’s video editing, practice the skill by editing and uploading videos daily.You won’t gain high-quality followers by posting low-quality content that doesn’t add value to people’s lives.If you can create at least 10 quality posts every single day for 6 months, it will be impossible for people to ignore you!Use my Value Creator Writing Playbook as your launchpadCreate an OfferYou need 3 things to build an offer: Messaging.Use these 4 commandments:Quantifiable Time Frame Targeted Risk Reversal Example 1: I help fitness coaches (targeted) gain 1,000 followers (quantifiable) in 30 days (time frame) or I work for free (risk reversal).Example 2: I help cleaning businesses (targeted) increase their website traffic by 15% (quantifiable) in 45 days (time frame) or you get 50% of your money back. (risk reversal) Deliverables. Examples:I will write 60 posts a month. I will redesign your website and write 4 blogs a month. Pricing. I can’t tell you exactly how much you should price your services because it all depends. Depending on your niche and skill, check some other freelancers on social media or on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to see how they price their services.Use Yourself as a Case StudyThe paradox of service businesses:You need experience to win clients but you need clients to gain experience.That’s key. You don’t need client work; you need sample work.If you’re a video editor, upload videos with cool edits.If you’re a website designer, create 2-3 templates. If you’re a logo designer, create 5-10 logos. If you’re a ghostwriter, write posts daily. You are the case study.Remember that.Build a Lead GenerationHaving a landing page or email list is crucial.You can build a free email list with Convertkit or other similar software.I personally use a website on my personal domain, but it’s more technical.If you don’t want to spend any money, just use your social media page.If you’re using Instagram, create highlights based on your offer, sample work, testimonials, etc.Stay ConsistentWhile executing all the steps above, you must consistently post content.After you’ve finished with this article, check out this one on growing your personal brand.Get a simpler breakdown in the 7 Days Business ChallengeSelf-educate and practice your skills daily.Take this letter as a call-to-action.Don’t just read it and forget about it.Use it and implement each step accordingly.It will take time. Nothing good comes easy. However, making your first $1,000 depends on when you actually start working towards it.A message I wanted to share:I urge you to shift your focus from trying to outperform 99% of people to outperforming yourself:Your fears.Your doubts.Your bad habits.Your insecurities.Your limiting beliefs.Comparing yourself to others will only hold you back from success.Your focus should be on becoming the best version of yourself.Optimize your mind, and you change your life.Have a wonderful week friend." }, { "title": "you become the story you tell yourself - unbox yourself", "url": "/posts/you-become-the-story-you-tell-yourself/", "categories": "Personal Growth, Business", "tags": "letters, growth, business", "date": "2024-05-11 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "Life makes sense through a series of stories presented to your awareness.The information, ideologies, concepts and symbols that are exposed to your awareness becomes your story.This is how you make...", "content": "Life makes sense through a series of stories presented to your awareness.The information, ideologies, concepts and symbols that are exposed to your awareness becomes your story.This is how you make meaning of the world.Each story is built on top of the other. A layer on top of another layer.Everything you know is just a layer of stories pieced together for your understanding.Your mind makes sense and gives meaning to life through the series of stories you get exposed to.YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS SHAPED BY YOUR REALITYYour identity is shaped by the stories you tell yourself. If you are conscious about it. Or the story you are told to believe, if you are unconscious about it.From the day you were born your reality has been shaped up until now ( if you have not broken out of the cycle to pursue your own goals.) by parents, friends, teachers etc.You had to learn to navigate the world through the series of stories you were told. You were taught what a hand was. You were taught what a leg was. You were taught what body part you use to walk. Crazy to think about it, who knows how you’d learn to walk had you not been told to use your legs.As you grew up your parents told you what a cup was, and what it was used for. They told you the earth was round and the clouds live beyond the skies.These stories continue up to where you are told if you have to be happy you have to: go to college get good grades find a decent job retire at 60 and wait for deathSo your life has become an imitation of society. The stories passed to your parents passed down to you.That is exactly what humans do. They imitate for survival.We imitated our parents, teachers, and friends in order to learn how to function in the world.Without much awareness many stop there.Intelligent imitation comes after the fact. You learn from those that are condensing information you are curious about, dissect it, understand it, and experience it. How?Through self experimentation.Experiments = experience.If you don’t choose your own goals, society will choose for you.If you don’t choose your own values, society will choose for you.If you don’t choose your own beliefs, society will choose for you.SHAPE YOUR PERSPECTIVE - EXPERIMENTATIONLife itself is an ongoing experiment.Experimentation allows you to develop your own personal philosophies — guiding principles that shape how you approach life and how you interact with the world around you. These philosophies aren’t handed to you; they’re forged through your own experiences, insights, and reflections.Experimentation is how you form your life philosophy. It is how you set your own goals and remove the limiting beliefs society set for you.Without self experimentation, you go through life on autopilot. Like robots on an assembly line. Doing what you have been programmed to do without question.PURSUE YOUR OWN GOALSSince childhood I have been very curious about what lies beyond the average life. I was interested to understand if there was an alternative path aside the average one I see everyone take which is often dictated by society.From observation, it is not hard to see that those who find fulfillment in anything they are doing are those who have carved their own paths and are pursuing their own goals.Pure bliss is experienced when you do what you love. You are immersed into whatever you do because then you have an end goal in mind that fuels your decisions and actions.You have been able to break through the conditioning of the mind and are in control of your conscious thinking. You see life for what it is. A series of experiments until you find meaning.Those who have the freedom of thinking and unlimited mental potential pursue their own goals. They pursue personal projects they find meaning in or can attach a sense of worth.And they do it consciously.True fulfillment comes as a result of altering your state of consciousness. From a controlled mind to an independent mind.The only way to achieve that is by entering a state of optimal experience.Because your default state of mind is characterized by complete disorder, self-doubt, fear and jealousy.Consciousness creates order, making all of that self critique and mental chatter disappear.You experience heightened attention, loss of self and your information processing speeds up.Your path to mastery shortens, enabling you to cultivate any skill much faster.To achieve optimal experience you need to pursue your own goals not the ones society has set for you.Pursue meaningful project(s) that will become your life’s work.Life becomes more meaningful when you can connect everyday thoughts, experiences, information, and stimuli to a project.Struggle becomes meaningful because you know the end game.This is a completely different experience if you are working a job.A job can bring you a sense of meaning but it is fleeting.You are essentially pursuing someone’s goal and you are uncertain when they would remove you from their life’s work.Your actual job is to explore the unknown and make new discoveries by researching the crevice of reality that you feel the most compelled to. This is where you should draw your own meaning from and not by pursuing another person’s goals.Set your goals before you become an NPC.Life is a game. And every game has a story. An end game.What would be your story? Will your story be the story of the player, in control, or the character who does what he is programmed to do.UNBOX YOUR MINDBecause of your mental conditioning you have limited yourself to only one path to what you want to achieve - the end goal which is your happiness. To work a job and wait on a salary at the end of the month until you go on retirement.People are not that industrious because they fear risk. The average salary worker fears risk so he prefers to wait for the month to end so that he can receive his salary, pay the bills, take the children to school.Don’t you have more potential than that?Stop waiting on the government.Stop waiting for your parents.Stop waiting for your uncles.Stop waiting.Take your destiny into your hands.Early on in my career I had friends and family project their idea of a safe path to me. Some suggested I go to college to earn a teaching degree. Others wanted me to enter the police service.80% of living the life you want boils down to creating your own goals while most people are mindless slaves to society’s goals.Goals change how you interpret situations, which influences your actions, which programs your identity, which compounds over years into the good life.You can’t solve a problem unless you’re aware of it.You can’t become aware of a problem unless it impacts a goal.Most people don’t have goals. Most people are afraid to make mistakes. Most people don’t give themselves a chance to improve any aspect of their life.START A BUSINESSBusiness is where you pursue your own goals by solving a problem.Problems are everywhere and you have the skills and knowledge to solve them.You are a business. The one person business. If you are working at a job, you are a business in a bigger business. The fundamental function of a business is to solve people’s problems.If you solve problems at your job or solve your own problems you are qualified to start a business.Business is about solving problems.I have heard some people say business is not for everyone and I just think that is sheer gate keeping.Everyone is built for it if you strip away the business label and processes. It’s just solving problems for a living like we did before the industrial revolution.Here’s how to start. You do a 9-5 job and that means you have a skill. If you don’t have a skill you can go online right now and start learning, and implement what you learn to gain some skills. Solve a problem Share the solution Sell the implementationStart talking about the services you can offer.Start posting content that shows that you know your onions in the industry you find yourself; finance, health, education, agriculture, etc.If you can create at least 10 quality post every single day for 2 weeks, it will be impossible for people to ignore you!Use my Social Media Writing Simplified as your launchpadI know doctors and teachers who are into the Consulting business by just leveraging the internet and putting themselves out there.If you are in the finance industry start doing simple accounting services for people virtually.Create posts that tell the world you are available for accounting services.Market it shamelessly, give discounts.Before you know it you’re overbooked. You employ others. You make your millions.I can go on and on.If you want step-by-step courses and roadmaps for on how to start your online business, we teach this in Skillembassy Product Accelerator.BUILD A BUSINESS ONLINE!It is stupid to have a million dollar dream and let someone with a 10k salary talk you out of your goals.Do not shrink your ambitions to make other people feel comfortable around you. Excuse yourself from such environment.Go pitch your tent with folks who dream big, talk big and do big.If you don’t choose a struggle you’ll be assigned one.If you don’t choose the thing you want to suffer for, a goal or purpose then you’re going to be assigned one either way and that’s usually going to be a lot more difficult.You’re going to be assigned a job, you’re going to be assigned a life path, you’re going to be assigned what to learn.If you don’t make every decision or work to make every decision in your life conscious and intentional and by your own doing overtime, over a lot of time, then you’re going to fall into the trap of everyone else.You can see that most people are working towards goals that are not their own.That were projected onto them by their parents or their friends or whatever.They’re doing everything to fit in and conform, when that obviously leads to getting the same results as everyone else and getting the same results as everyone else is not fun.Like you can just look around and see that it’s not fun.CACHE YOUR MINDYour phone or computer starts to run slow, you clear cache to get it running more efficiently.To make the most of everything you have read up until now, you need to be conscious of what, and who you are imitating.Imitation is embedded in our microbiology as part of human survival.If you are exposing yourself to a person, what is their message?Are they promoting negativity and limiting beliefs that you will adopt? Or are they promoting growth, education, and showing you how to move in a positive life direction?What is their hierarchy of goals and does it align with yours?You’ve already got something trapped inside your mind that you are working to undo.Something that suffocates your dreams and you are hoping it dies.Then someone you are looking up to keeps awakening those limiting beliefs.Then BOOM it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise.Hovers over you to tell you millions of lies.The point I’m making is, the mind is a powerful place.And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way.Just think about it for a second.If you look at your face every day when you get up and think you’ll never be great, You’ll never be great, not because you’re not, but because of the condition you have passed your mind through.It will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith.Your attention is going somewhere, might as well fuel what you believe in (and what you want to become). Stay conscious. Don’t put yourself in a box.Thank you for reading and have a wonderful week." }, { "title": "don't be normal", "url": "/posts/dont-be-normal/", "categories": "Growth, Learning", "tags": "letters, growth, learning", "date": "2024-05-04 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "When you are growing up everybody tells you to be normal.From the moment you were born, society molds you into cookie-cutter versions of itself. “Be normal.” “Don’t rock the boat.

That means embracing uncertainty. That means being willing to fail, and fail spectacularly if need be.If you want to achieve greatness, you’ve got to be willing to put in the work.Be willing to go above and beyond what’s expected of you.Pay attention to the world around you.Notice the opportunities that others overlook.Be curious, be adventurous, be bold.It’s not enough to just go through the motions of life, to settle for the status quo.Aim high and dream big.Defy expectations and carve out your own path.HOW TO LIVE AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE1. Learn and Build stuff.Educate yourself.When a question about a certain topic pops up, googleit.Watch Youtube tutorials and documentaries.When something sparks your interest,read about it. Read read read.Study, learn, stimulate your brain.Don’t just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours.Skills not learnt in school are the source of income not found in employment.2. Make tiny improvementsYou can’t go to level 10 with level 1 habits. Read one page a day. Write one page a day. Workout for 30mins.Then focus on getting 1% better every day. Minor improvements over time lead to big changes.3. Control your actions.You don’t have to answer and react to everything.There are certain things you can’t control.Reacting to everything around you is a sign of impulsiveness.Be proactive, not reactive.4. Try new thingsIf you don’t try new things, you’ll miss out on awesome and fantastic adventures and experiences.If you don’t try new things, you’ll never know what you can do.Do what you do everyday all the time, you will always get what you’ve always gotten.Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.The person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing.He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love and live fully." }, { "title": "you don't have a time problem you have a mindset problem", "url": "/posts/you-don't-have-a-time-problem-you-have-a-mindset-problem/", "categories": "Mindset, Business", "tags": "letters, business, mindset", "date": "2024-04-27 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "You can win at life if you look at failures as wins.

At certain points I decide to pursue new things in my life.I realized that life becomes meaningful when I am solving a problem that requires my attention, focus and skill.You are a Value Creator.If you can solve a problem at your job that solves the pain points of the customers of your company, you are qualified to start a business.Everyone is built to be an entrepreneur.If you strip away the business label and processes.It’s just solving problems for a living like we did before the industrial revolution.Yes the path to entrepreneurship is individual but everyone has the same problems.There are four eternal markets in business you can explore: health wealth relationships happinessIt took me 3 years of failing to find something I love doing. ( I build stuff on the internet and pass down the knowledge)I quit my second job to build something off the ground.This was my first experience putting every resource: money, skill, network, together to build something off the ground on the internet.We burnt lots of cash.We had many sleepless nights.We had lots of failures in many places.However in business: Every failure is a lesson Every failure builds character. Every failure brings you closer to discovering and fulfillingyour purposeIf you started anything new and you are faced with hardships, failures and disappointments.Keep in mind that every experience serves a bigger purpose.Stories give meaning to life.Your mindset and identity is the story you tell yourself.You will live out that story on auto if not brought in front of your conscious mind.If not made conscious, it is impossible for it to end in your favor.Most people don’t start a business because of one thing.Time.I understand it. It can be a lot.You feel you can’t just quit your job and pursue something you don’t know is going to pay off.And so you postpone what you want to do to tomorrow.How you’ve been conditioned to making money has hugely impacted how you think about the process of making money.You think you can only make money by working a job and expecting a paycheck at the end of every month.When was the last time you read a business book? When was the last time you attended a business seminar?When was the last time you listened to a business podcast?The difference between an employee and an entrepreneur is control over your potential.Everyone is an entrepreneur.Some just choose to get paid for the problems they solve in their personal life.If you don’t create a career, you’ll be assigned one.Business is how You solve a problem in your life that births a profitable solution. Build an audience by distributing your value through content and writing. Turn your solution into a product and iterate until you make as much as you want. Don’t rely on a paycheck for your survival. Transcend your survival through entrepreneurship and remove the earning limit from your life. You don’t need more time.You just need to know your ‘why’.Motivation is fleeting and hard to fall back on when you’re exhausted from work or you have other responsibilities.For me, discovering I can build a business on the internet completely changed the way I saw business.You’d be surprised how easy it is to make your first dollar using only a laptop.Turn your ideas into a one-person digital business.“But how Patrick?!”If you want to develop your mindset, skillset, spirituality, and business — join Digital Mastery for proven frameworks, systems, step-by-step roadmaps, and personalized help.If you have no idea where to start, stop overthinking.Just start somewhere.Find something you enjoy, see where it’s working for other people then replicate.Reverse engineer things.It’s a rule of any business. Find what works Add a slight tweak to make it betterIf that tweak makes a large enough splash, people will come flooding to you.Don’t try to reinvent the wheel.Over time you’ll learn more about what works and what you enjoy.The key is to get over this first hurdle.That’s how I made over ₵5,000 in less than a month passing down the knowledge in my head.It started as my genuine passion to get out of my bored mind.People think it’s wonderful to retire and they’re going to do whatever they want to do; play golf or go swimming or go to the Resorts.But after a while they get bored and they don’t know what to do with their lives and many of them die.It’s really important to have some reason to be existing and so what I really like is to keep busy with a personal project.You need a project.Not just any project, but something that ignites your passion and commands your attention.Why? Because a project gives you purpose. It’s the North Star guiding you through the sea of distractions.Build a project that actualizes your ideal future.You don’t need to quit your job ( this is the ideal choice because business requires focus and attention initially but if you can’t do that ) to make decent money on the side.It just takes focus and commitment.It is your job to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.If you don’t know what to build, start with: What you already use, but make it better. A problem you’ve solved in your life. Building what you want to see in the world.If you want to be the person that creates wealth solve problems.If I were to start a business in 2024 this is how I’d go about it: 1 hour of writing. 1 hour of building. 1 hour of learning. 1 hour of networking.This simple formula holds the key to unlocking a future where you’re not just working to live but living to thrive.Imagine dedicating just one hour each day to these four pillars of growth.1 Hour of WritingIn the 1 hour of writing, you’re not just jotting down words, you’re crafting the narrative of your journey, honing your voice, and sharing your wisdom with the world.Write to distribute ideas.Writing is not a skill, it’s a way of life. Capture ideas Connect ideas Create ideas Articulate ideas Share ideasWriting is how you become a vessel for value.Every situation becomes a meaningful opportunity to collect valuable information to share with the world.Everything you need to write and post on social media has been Simplified here in my Social Media Writing SimplifiedEveryone is creative, but most people forget they have the power to achieve anything they want in life.Looks decrease with time, intelligence increases with time.Both are important, but one is a much better bet for your future.1 Hour of BuildingYou build the foundation of your dreams, brick by brick, line by line.Build something tangible and lasting.Nobody will give you money for free.Create a solution to a problem.Persuade people to buy the solution.Learn how to build and sell.Money becomes easy to get.1 Hour of LearningExpand your mind, acquire new skills.Stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving world.Learning is the foundation of the human experience.Educate yourself.When a question about a certain topic pops up, google it.Watch movies and documentaries.When something sparks your interest, read about it.Read read read.Study, learn, stimulate your brain.Don’t just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours.Learn skills that cannot be learned in school.Follow your curiosities and solve your own problems for personal evolution.And get results that cannot be achieved in employment.Use the Internet as a creative extension of yourself.1 Hour of NetworkingCultivate relationships, forge partnerships, and build a community that supports and uplifts you on your journey.Do this every day for a year, and you’ll see the transformation unfold before your eyes.You’ll have a brand that resonates, a business that thrives, and a career that fulfills you in ways you never thought possible.Someone with a great network and good connections will achieve 10x your success with a 10th of your effort.Not many things in life can be obtained purely by merit.The who-you-know factor is more important than you realize.Anyone who tells you that their success was achieved purely through hard work is probably lying to you.I hope this helps.

This is something you have absolutely no control over.What you have control over, to some degree is how you respond to it.At a certain point I felt the burden of life over my shoulders.I felt I was a loser.I saw myself as a loser because I hadn’t achieved certain expectations of society.I was thrown in a deep pit of self pity, regrets, low self confidence and a poor outlook on life.Everything changed when I had a different perspective of the situation.The first time I watched the story of how Elon Musk built his Space X company was a turn around for me.“Elon had gone to Russia to negotiate a deal to buy space rockets for future mission to Mars.The Russians wanted $8 million dollars for a single rocket.Elon was willing to pay the $8 million dollars, but for that price, he wanted two rockets.The Russians held firm to their original pricing and wouldn’t cut a deal with Elon, so he stormed out of the meeting into the freezing Moscow air outside and took a cab back to the airport.He became obsessed with knowing all he could about rocket technology, reading as many books as he could on the topic.Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, and has since developed a series of next-generation rockets that can deliver payloads to space.In 2010, SpaceX became the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and bring it back to Earth.” People that introduce you to new ways of thinking and new ways of seeing life are so important.Your perspective shapes your reality.If you believe you can’t do something, you will live your whole life believing you can’t do it.If someone showed you how it’s possible because they did it, you are set free from that mental prison.Change starts from the mind.If your mindset sucks,Nothing will work.The right mindset makes everything right. If your life sucks try new things. If you feel you are not making any progress try new things.-If your mind is clogged and your perspective looks blurred try new things. If you feel a limit on your mental ability and creative potent try new things.Try and find a thing that you really enjoy.Try and find a thing that you’re passionate about.For me early on it was reading.And it progressed to writing.I wanted to be an author.Then it went from reading novels and writing poems and letters to my high school crush to another thing.It was just another thing that I was extremely passionate about.I dived into reading engineering books and then watching Youtube videos on how people build websites and Softwares.I listened to Podcasts that talked about how companies were built.To me understanding came from diving deeper into topics that were new to me.This exposed me to design, marketing, coding, sales, philosophy and writing.This was my vehicle out of my dilemma.This was my vehicle out of my own anxiety,self pity,regrets,low self confidence,and a poor outlook on life.Find something that you genuinely enjoy because getting good atthings you genuinely enjoy is extremely beneficial to your spiritual and physical growth.Every person thinks they are a loser until they find something they genuinely love doing. Then work becomes like play.I didn’t know I wasn’t a loser until I learned how to design.I didn’t know I wasn’t a loser until I learned how to code.I didn’t know I wasn’t a loser until I started an Internet business.I didn’t know I wasn’t a loser until I started winning.Coding taught me that I could get better at stuff.I wasn’t a loser. I was just someone in a f*cked up situation.What you can do:Channel all that energy into something and get better at it.I went from someone who was incredibly insecure and basically a failure to someone who was really confident and self motivated.And then all of a sudden people started to admire me.Nothing happens, then everything happens.I went from an insecure person and a failure to someone who was really successful at this one thing that was considered hard and other people were scared of.That gave me immense confidence and also a real understanding of the direct correlation between the hardwork and success.This can be applied to different areas of life.The glass ceiling on your mind will affect yourrelationships,business,career,health.Quit thinking like a loser.Start thinking like a winner.Perspective shapes reality.Your perspective is shaped by the stuff you let into your zone.If you’re constantly feeding your brain junk food, mindless TV, gossip magazines, endless scrolling through social mediaexpect a clogged mindset limited by self pity and anxiety.But flip the script.Surround yourself with great and useful stuff: podcasts, inspiring books, well informed articles wonderful personalitiessuddenly, your perspective starts to shift. You’re exposed to new ideas, different viewpoints, and before you know it, you’re seeing the world through a whole new lens.Pay attention to what you consume, my friend.Because whether you realize it or not, it’s shaping your reality.Want great ideas? Consume great content. It’s that simple.Lessons to learn here:We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on thatFind out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you.Take small steps toward it every day, and set aside the larger vision for a time.For the time being, follow your curiosity; if you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.Rid yourself of negative self talkTake charge of who you are and what you want for yourself.Stop downplaying what you care about and your hopes. Own your fire Own your no-saying and yes-saying Take charge of your emotions and mood Take control of your desires, ideas, and perceptions Take charge of your plans, your path, and your successAlmost every successful person begins with two convictions: the future can be better than the present and I have the ability to make it so.Surround yourself with like minded peopleA lot of things also come down to identity.Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible.Therefore make sure the people you move with share similar visions and goals with you.Otherwise you will lose your sense of purpose and get distracted towards your goals and journey to a better version of yourself.Read books no one readsRead on topics that interest you that you don’t know much about.George R.R. Martin once said, “I have lived a thousand lives and I have loved a thousand loves. I’ve walked on distant worlds and seen the end of time. Because I read.”It is enjoyable, inexpensive, and beneficial to read books.A single best selling book will keep you entertained for several hours.As well as prompt you to analyze and reassess certain aspects of the world around you.And, what’s more, you can get that one book for almost nothing.Drastically reduce your time on social mediaYou are unaware of many mental processes that occur when you are doom scrolling on social media.What is genuine and truthful in your story becomes clouded.You don’t consciously think about it, yet it happens all the time.It may mostly influence your confidence and self-worth, especially if you start comparing our lives to those you see on social media, which are frequently not as they appear.Spend more time reading, building, trying new things, spending time in nature.Those are the approaches to live a genuine life.To use social media:Log in,get what you want,log off,go touch some grass.Start changing slowly, take baby steps.Slow but steady progress.There’s nothing more attractive than someone who knows exactly what they want and are dedicated to get it.Make this shift in your life.Start with baby steps as you grow into the person you want to become.Just as the saying goes, “Dream big and Start small.”Hope this helps.

You need to take action.Anytime I learnt something new I made sure to build a project from it.I started a freelancing service when I learnt design.I built my blog website when I learnt how to code.I started my Letters when I took a Digital Marketing course.My first business, TS Collections was after quitting my 9-5 job to experiment with digital product development.I started Skillembassy after I completed the product design and management bootcamp.Practice solidifies what you learn. That is how companies were built.If you don’t apply what you learn to a problem sitting in your head, your mind gets fat from too much information just sitting in your head. Mental obesity.Knowledge is relevant, but it’s useless without implementation.You have subscribed to 5 - 10 courses, tutorials, newsletters and podcasts promising to unlock the secrets to your success.The missing link isn’t the latest tip or trick – it’s the will to move from consuming information to executing it.I have a philosophy that I apply to learning. This has helped me to get actual things done 10X faster: learn, build, expand.You need habits to get results, not just knowledge.The first step to transform your life is to transform your mind.The second is to adapt new habits.You don’t go through a whole course with the intention to apply what you learn to a new project later. It is a flawed approach. You need to adapt to a new habit. Outline a project you want to build Start building it out Learn along the wayThis means that you use the knowledge you acquire on the project.This is where a lot of people get trapped in tutorial hell, stacking up information that is going to be forgotten in the next 5 minutes.If you aren’t building, you aren’t learning.Remember what we spoke about habits. Yes, you can’t continue to do the same thing and expect different results. That is called madness.A new habit you should adopt to learn 10X faster:I am going to pick a few insights from a blog post I read over the week.Essentially it is what I want to tell you so I will go ahead and save some time and thinking space.1. Outline a projectThere were a few moments in my life when I made giant leaps in learning, understanding, and progress: Building my products Writing these newsletters What do they all have in common?I treat them as a project.A project has: An outline so you can note ideas to fill in that outline from everyday life. Milestones so you have direction and clarity on your next steps. A real-world deadline that forces you to act, or else your survival takes a hit. Experimentation, trial, and error so you can turn failures into lessons.Create a real-world project that you will publish for others to see.If you don’t know what project to create, see what others have done.If you want to learn Photoshop, your project will be anything from a graphic to a digital art scene.2. Learn, BuildIf you aren’t building, you aren’t learning.If you aren’t actively applying what you learn to a problem sitting in your mind, you are simply stacking useless knowledge to be forgotten in the next 5 minutes.When you start building something, there are only a few things you need to know: the fundamentals.When you have a project to build, do one or both of the following: Purchase a beginner-level course on the topic Watch overview videos on YouTube that teach the fundamentals Study them until you have clarity on what to do next. Then, do it, and when you encounter a problem:Refer back to sections of the course or videoResearch how to solve that problem directlyWatch tutorials where people build projects similar to yours and see how they overcome those problems.3. Teach What You LearnTeaching in public by writing as a personal brand (or your public resume) so you can also attract high-paying opportunities as you learn. (This is what I teach in Digital Mastery program).Build in public and let people criticize you.Teach your friends to make for interesting conversations.Take notes on the subject but write them as if you were teaching yourself.Teaching almost forces you to make sense of the information.You have to structure it, explain it, and ensure that you aren’t giving false knowledge.4. ExpandBy this point, you may still feel overwhelmed or like you aren’t learning much.This is a good thing.Your mind is primed for pattern recognition.So: Launch yourself into the unknown – immerse yourself in the culture, environment, and information related to what you are trying to learn. Condition your mind through repetition and exposure – slowly understand the lingo, vocabulary, and skill set of those who have seen success in that topic. Let your mind expand through the discomfort – the worst thing you can do is quit when you are feeling growing pains.You aren’t seeing results because you aren’t the person who would see results.This process allows you to become a new person by letting your old version die.Like when you are adopting new habits, you have to get out of the old environment that fueled your bad habits.To make this more practical: Read books – books give you 10 years of effort from 6 hours of reading.Consume lectures – long articles and videos give you 3 days of effort in 20 minutes.Follow new people – this is less about consuming short-form content and more about training your mind to be in that tribe of people.Buy 3 books.One best-seller, one technical, and one historical.Burn through them and don’t let your obsession die.This may seem like a long process, but we aren’t trying to learn something on a surface level, we are trying to become masters as fast as possible.5. Make Connections To Solidify UnderstandingWhen you master one thing, it becomes easier to master others.Principles are Universal. They overlap.When you master fitness, you can master business in half the time, and then relationships in another half.Most people never master one domain of their lives, so they never experience exponential personal growth.When you feel like you have a solid understanding of the topic you are trying to learn: Zoom out one layer – move from “Photoshop” to “graphic design” to “creative work.”Take note of signal – when your mind signals important information, write it down.Build better projects – from a new level of mind, build a new project that will take you to the success you want to see.In my own experience, my knowledge compounded when I peeled back a layer from web design to marketing to content creation to metaphysics.This is also a great way to start your one-person business.Start by learning, teaching, and building in one domain then branch out as your audience expands.We help you do this and start your digital career in 90 days inside SkillembassyYou don’t need more information – you need to start using what you’ve got.Make mistakes, learn from them, and keep pushing forward. The only way to truly improve is through active experimentation.Now, go learn, build, and enjoy your weekend." }, { "title": "the only way to stop being broke", "url": "/posts/how-stop-being-broke/", "categories": "Learning, Business", "tags": "letters, learning, business", "date": "2024-04-06 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "7 years ago, I was broke with 0 influence and 0 career opportunities.The way to stop being broke is to learn a high-value skill, build a strong online presence, sell a product, your skills, or offe...", "content": "7 years ago, I was broke with 0 influence and 0 career opportunities.The way to stop being broke is to learn a high-value skill, build a strong online presence, sell a product, your skills, or offer a unique service.Expand what you do.Growing up I noticed a trend that made me question what career path I wanted to pursue in life.I saw people work into jobs they hated.Retire at 60 and live a boring lifestyle the rest of their lives.I literally remember one neighbor who would curse all day because his kids had not sent him or delayed his allowance for the month. He literally depended on his kids for everything.In primary school I saw most of my colleagues answer “What do you want to become in future” to the same job this man did before he retired.This sparked my curiosity and so I started looking into myself to identify what I am passionate about and can pursue as a career.I was constantly questioning myself on what other paths I can take that will not end me up at the same place as our neighbor.I was aware of only one path in life:Go to school.Get a decent job.Retire at 60 years young.Have enough money to survive and die.I was in my 19’s when my curiosity led me to the city.When I moved from my small town to the city I met many people making millions online and traveling the world with their laptops but never I looked into how they actually did it.Until one day, when a friend I made at a meetup reached out to me and asked if I wanted to start a business with him.I said, “How are we going to do this?”He asked me, “What skillset do you have that you’re really good at and is your first choice?”I said, “communication design ( design and communication).”He said, “I want you to enroll in a design course and let’s start a business”I spent 6 months online behind my computer to learn high value skills and build an online presence.4 years later, we’ve made a huge trajectory.We helped other people who were lost in their career to find a high paying job, discover their passion and land international offers.How?The only way to stop being broke is to learn high-value skills, build your online presence, sell a product, your skills, or offer a unique service.The world is an interconnected village.Traditional employment models are no longer the only path to financial security.If you have the internet and digital technology, there are endless opportunities to create income streams and build wealth on your terms.A laptop is a machine that you can use to earn money, sitting anywhere in the world, as long as it is connected to the internet.Step 1: Learn - Invest In YourselfInvest in yourself.Acquire high-value skills that are in demand in the marketplace.Whether it’s coding, marketing, communication design, sales or copywriting, mastering a valuable skill set opens doors to life time opportunities.2 rules for a great life: Learn what can’t be taught in schools Do what can’t be replaced in workYou are not where you want to be because you are not the type of person who is supposed to be there.Being inexperienced and willing to learn is better than being experienced and thinking you know it all.There’s a gap between your current self and your future self; bridge the gap with self education and personal experience.7 years ago I started with: no skill. directionless. spending money on things I didn’t need.Then I enrolled in a design course and got my first client.Today I: own a startup. giving others skills. can monetize anything.This is how life changes.1 decision! Pick something you like. Don’t follow trends, choose a skill that excites you. Start small. Just 15 minutes a day is enough to make progress. Don’t sweat mistakes. Focus on learning, not being perfect. You can create a career for yourself by doing just what you love doing.Step 2: Build - Start a ProjectMost people use learning as a way to feel good about making progress when, in reality, they aren’t learning or making progress. If you don’t have a project, business, or purpose to apply what you learn, you are lost.You need a project to build.Something that you can invest your focus into. Something that has more gravity than distractions. Something that will bring you one level closer to the life you want.People who learn to build are people who attain personal and financial freedom.It is your job to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.If you don’t know what to build, start with: what you already use, but make it better. a problem you’ve solved in your life. building what you want to see in the world.If you want to be the person that creates wealth solve problems.If you have solved a problem in your life, and other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it. build in the morning learn in the afternoon use the evening to replenish energyStudy less, build more, and your skill set will be forced to grow.This is what I teach in my community of Creative Builders. Get instant access: Skillembassy for a limited time.Step 3: Expand - Build LeverageLeverage the internet to build your online presence and showcase your expertise to the world.Create a professional website, establish a strong presence on social media platforms, and consistently produce valuable content that demonstrates your knowledge and skills.To make any kind of money in today’s internet world, you must deliver substantial value, build a brand that people trust, and be authentic.1. Build a brandAn audience or readership or just distribution in general is how you get a job without a job board, sell a book without a publisher, and make music without a record deal.Build a personal brand that talks about your interest and shows your authentic self.People are starting to realize that personal brands have more influence than any other kind of lead generation mechanism.That’s what a personal brand is. A lead generation mechanism for your products or services.The cool thing is, all you do is talk about your interests, what you are learning, and your expertise.People want to work with you because they connect with you on a human level.Pick 1 social media platform you spend most of your time on. create content around your niche as value post content and promote your products or services build your brand and ensure your profile and activity clearly communicate the value get seenThat’s how you will navigate and succeed in the internet business game.Be you, learn to persuade and you get to skip ahead of those that lack distribution.2. MonetizeOnce you have built your digital presence, explore various avenues to monetize your expertise.You can sell digital productsLaunch an e-book or online courseOffering consulting servicesFreelance in your area of expertisePeople buy with emotion then justify with logic.Sell the transformation not the product.It’s easier to sell something that solves a pain than fulfills a desire.Whatever business you’re in, study psychology and body language.When dollars start hitting your account expand your offerings and explore new opportunities.Continuously seek ways to innovate and add value to your offerings, and be open to adapting to changing market dynamics.When I was starting out I had no one to tell me this was the only way to build faster online.I wouldn’t have spent too much time trying to wait on people to help me get a job or help me with something to get by.If you didn’t note down anything at all, this should get you started.How to not stay broke:If you hate working long hours: Learn a high impact skill Finally start a business Work on it for 1 hour each day Fire your boss from your life Work whenever you wantYou will never work less if you don’t create your own way of doing so.Hope this helps.

You need less distractions.Quit your excuses and read for 5-minutes.You can’t self-develop without making learning a habit.Meaningful work includes 3 things: Curiosity: learning what you care about Mastery: improving what you care about Purpose: working on what you care aboutConsistent effort adds up faster than you might think.While others are standing still, you’re moving forward, one small step at a time.2. BUILDLearning must be done coherently with building.Mental obesity is when you learn without using the information to solve a problem sitting in your head.If you keep learning without taking action,You won’t see results.If you keep taking action without learning,You’ll work harder but might not get better results.You need them both to succeed at whatever you do.Keep learningKeep taking actionAnd it’ll only be a matter of time before you achieve the results you desire.You don’t need a lot to make it work.Learn the minimum skills you need and then Build.You’ll learn everything else along the way.3. EXPANDYou grow when you contribute to the collective knowledge.Those who give value receive value.If you aren’t happy with how much you make, it may be time to take a brutally honest look at what you contribute to the world.The world runs on value exchange.Your products, services, or ideas are your contribution to the world.Create value by sharing what you know.When you contribute to the collective knowledge—whether it’s by writing, teaching, or sharing insights—you’re not just helping others, you’re also growing yourself.The more you give the more you receive.This is not some fluffy concept; it’s a fundamental truth of life.Do some self reflection.Ask yourself: What am I contributing to the world? Am I sharing my knowledge, my skills, my talents in a way that adds value to others? And if not, what can I do differently?When you focus on giving—on truly making a difference in the lives of others—that’s when opportunities start to flow, and your impact starts to ripple out into the world.Hope this helps.Talk soon." }, { "title": "do not try to be an expert (do this instead)", "url": "/posts/do-not-try-to-be-an-expert-do-this-instead/", "categories": "Action, Procrastination", "tags": "letters, procrastination, action", "date": "2024-03-23 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "I made a shocking revelation after spending many years learning how to learn.You don’t get results from what you learn because you learn like any ordinary person.Most people go about learning the w...", "content": "I made a shocking revelation after spending many years learning how to learn.You don’t get results from what you learn because you learn like any ordinary person.Most people go about learning the wrong way.The mistake is wanting to do something but not executing on it.There’s a hundred steps to start a business, a youtube channel or a podcast and you’re focusing on steps 2 to 100 and that’s causing you to be overwhelmed.You spend too much time on tutorials and don’t get any results.In your mind you think you need to learn everything first before you apply what you learn.There are people who are doing way better than you right now.The shocking thing is that, these people do not know half of what you know, yet they’re doing better than you.You’ve been stuck in the loop of trying to become an expert before even taking the first step.If you consume too much and don’t use it to build, your mind gets fat.Don’t wait until you have all the knowledge before beginning something. That only leads to procrastination and unnecessary delays. Instead, change your approach. Begin right away, and learn as you go.Build. Learn:Think about it. The best way to learn how to swim isn’t by reading every book on swimming technique—you jump into the pool and paddle around until you figure it out.The same goes for anything else you want to master. Whether it’s starting a business, learning a new skill, or pursuing a passion project, the most effective approach is to dive right in and learn as you go.Stop complaining about your lack of results.Complain about your lack of action.Stop debating, planning, and putting things onhold. Write the book Launch the podcast Start building online Start the side hustle Build an inbound business Build multiple income streams Start the company you always wanted Build your personal brand and become thego-to in your industryStop putting yourself down.You don’t have to be an expert or have it allfigured out.It’s you vs you.You don’t try to make your first attempt perfect.Try to make your imperfect first attempt better.Begin anything you want to do by first starting and then look for resources and information that will guide you through what you want to do.Want to learn design? Install and launch Photoshop.Want to build your portfolio? Install and launch VS Code.Want to start a business? Sell your product to your college friends.Remove the fear of failing by first starting.Iterate your processes through feedback.Get resources that can teach you how to improve your product or service.Watch YouTube videos.Take a course.Read a book.You can’t improve something that doesn’t exist.First start andRemove the fear barrier. No matter how half-baked or incoherent Do not stall over perfecting the first draft You can always revise and improve laterJust record your processes. Go back and refine them.It is no good if you are an expert in knowledge and a novice in practice.The quest to be an expert before you start anything can be a paralyzing trap.Supplement with Resources:When you start building something, there are only a few things you need to know: the fundamentals.Delve into advanced tactics only when you’ve gained a solid understanding of the basics.The fundamentals will take you 80% of the way there.Advanced tactics will take you the next 20% of the way.Reserve mental energy for obsession, mastery, and honing a few specific skills and interests.When you have a project to build, do one or both of the following:Purchase a beginner-level course on the topic.Watch overview videos on YouTube that teach the fundamentalsStudy them until you have clarity on what to do next. Then, do it, and when you encounter a problem:Refer back to sections of the course or video.Research how to solve that problem directly.Watch tutorials where people build projects similar to yours and see how they overcome those problems.I created my first design project in Canva before signing up for a design course.I built my first portfolio website alongside FreeCodeCamp web development course.Ideas don’t come fully formed. When you start without knowing it all.Your mind begins to look for information to piece the puzzle together.Waiting for the stars to align, for every detail to be just right, for that elusive moment of “readiness” that never truly comes is a sure sign to not build anything meaningful in your life.Let me give you something to ponder over:You can’t improve something that doesn’t exist. Launch the project when it’s not perfect. Start the business when you feel you don’t know enough.It’s a liberating truth—improvement, refinement, and growth can only happen after you take the first, imperfect step.The first version of anything is rarely its best version.Without that initial launch, that first step into the unknown, there would be nothing to refine, nothing to improve, nothing to grow from.Figma started as a drone company.Twitter started as a podcast app.Instagram was a location-based social network.I went from 3 failures before I could launch my first business.Starting is what you need to get to your destination.This is what I teach you in the Product Accelerator program.The upcoming cohort 3.0 is your roadmap.In 10 weeks, I’ll teach you everything I’ve learned about online business, marketing, content creation, digital resume, product building, and offer creation.I know you are thinkingBut what if I make mistakes.Sure, you’ll make mistakes. You’ll encounter obstacles.There is no solid learning without mistakes.Your mind builds a map through repetition, failures and getting things right.The knowledge you gain through experience is far more valuable than anything you could glean from a textbook or a webinar.There is pattern recognition for novelty and dopamine, clarity from milestones, challenge from deadlines, and feedback from reality.Determine what you want to learn.Create a real-world project that you will publish for others to see.If you don’t know what project to create, see what others have done.A personal project is an experience anchor.So, enough with the excuses. Stop waiting for the perfect moment, the perfect plan, or the perfect set of skills.There will never be a better time to start than right now.Those dumber than you are making billions.Not because they’re more skilled than you.Not because they’re more connected than you are or more popular than you.Not because they’re more talented or has better life opportunities.They’re doing better than you simply because they took action, even when they didn’t have a full understanding of they were doing.They took a leap of faith and backed it up with a rugged determination and crazy work ethic.They did not sit and analyze everyday to end up doing nothing.They do not sit and browse all day in the name of seeking for more knowledge.They took action based on the little they’ve learnt and the little understanding they have.They’re doing better than you right now because they refused to procrastinate. They refused to submit to their fears.They’re doing better than you because they’re more willing to test, fail and go again, without giving up hope or losing momentum.Oh, and before I forget…They’re doing way better than you at the moment because…You know what? Nevermind.Embrace uncertainty, and trust that you’ll figure it out as you go.You don’t have to be an expert to get started. But you do have to start if you ever want to become one.Hope this helps.

It is a new decentralized school system because centralized schools survive by training you into the society that funds them.7 years ago, I had no direction with my life.I had 0 influence and 0 career opportunities.I used the internet to learn high value skills and built a digital identity.I could solve business problems.My first managerial position came after completing an online course and sharing my accomplishments.It brought me a whole world of career opportunities and meaningful relationships.I gained the skills to start my online business.How?learn high value skillstake notesbuild capacitybuild a business or build a small personal project This can be creating a newsletter and sharing what you learn/t.

Excuse yourself from such environment.Go pitch your tent with folks who dream big, talk big and do big.Society won’t respect you because you did what they expected from you.People respect you once you do your own thing and go way beyond what they thought you could achieve, at which point, you will also realize that you no longer really care about their validation." }, { "title": "i learnt a high impact skill and doubled my $$ income in 6 months", "url": "/posts/i-learnt-a-high-impact-skill-and-doubled-my-income-in-6-months/", "categories": "Learning, Personal Development", "tags": "letters, learning, personal development", "date": "2024-03-09 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "7 years ago, I was a broke guy with 0 followers and 0 career opportunities.I spent 6 months online behind my computer to learn high impact skills and build an online presence.2 years later, I’ve ma...", "content": "7 years ago, I was a broke guy with 0 followers and 0 career opportunities.I spent 6 months online behind my computer to learn high impact skills and build an online presence.2 years later, I’ve made a huge trajectory, I’ve had the opportunity to work with well known companies both home and abroad just by putting myself out there.How?By mastering the art of building a digital resume.Nothing is more powerful in the digital era.Companies hire based on your online portfolio.Companies hire individuals with influence to push their brand forward.We were all here when we saw Khaby Lame rise to the top to win international deals and awards.

I had a picture of the path I wanted to take.When I reached my teens society handed me a different plan.Everybody told me to go to college, find a job, save enough money and retire at 60.And so most people have the goal of going to college, getting a job and retiring at 60.When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is.And your your life is just to live your life inside the world.Try not to bash into the walls too much.Try to have a nice family life. Have fun. Save a little of money.That’s a very limited life.People are used to the ‘linear’ approach to things.So when attempting something new you have to hit multiple brick walls.This is the way ideas interact with reality.Which is in fact a pretty dense structure of infinite interrelated components.I always wanted do my own thing. And when I talk about my ‘own’ thing I mean a personal project - a business.I was quite early to know that the best way to live a fulfilling life is to work on a project that you can relate and find meaning in.If you don’t work on your own project you will be assigned to work on someone else’s project.I’m just wasting my time at that point.Why am I going to continue working on a project if it doesn’t give me any meaning? Business is a personal project and every entrepreneur was trying to solve a personal project whether they had the intention to sell the solution or not.There’s no substitute for doing your own work.While I was doing my 9-5 I was spending 2-4 hours everyday learning.If you want to get anywhere in life and you lack the skill you have to bridge the gap with self education and personal experience.To get anywhere in life you have to work extremely hard and you have to be disciplined.If you wanted to be a great piano player there’s no drug you can take.There’s no self-help book.You got to spend 5 years, 10 years learning it until it becomes something of second nature.Then you can play chords you could never play before. And that’s the paradigm for everything meaningful in life.There are no shortcuts.Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.If you learn something well and build business for yourself it can bring you a far greater pleasure than any kind of employment you will do for anybody.But you have to be patient and you have to not be afraid of boredom and you have to not be afraid of the effort and going off the broad way.The mind seeks order and society sell it cheap. And so many people have subscribed to the single way of doing something.By the time you become an adult , you rarely notice that you’ve been doing the same thing as everyone else. And you are bound to get the same result.I wanted something different. Something greater than the average life.Which is what life should be about.Living up to our greatest potential.When I started out I didn’t have all the resources and technology I need to work with.So if it was as some prefer it and it was all about getting everything ready, then I was doomed.Because circumstances changed and I found myself having to navigate life and start my own business.I took an inventory of all that I didn’t have, and all that I did have.And created opportunities out of what I did have.I chose discomfort severally, to work on the things I didn’t have.I am still playing the long game.I’m putting in the work.And have met incredible people through networking who are guiding my journey.It’s not about what you have or where you were born.It’s about what you make with what you have.I’ve met so many people who have the urge to build their own thing but have yet to start.Immerse yourself in learning. Seek knowledge and skills to improve your current self.The more time you spend learningYou can tailor things to go your wayIt’s good to learn from different set of peopleBut you have to find your own voice alsoDo yourself a favor.Build and learn along the way.It’s not the easiest way to start a business, but it is the best.The rate of feedback cycles from multiple sources a day will be massive.Iterate based on feedback.Stack experience.Stack results.Win at life.For the time being, follow your curiosity.If you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.Happy New Month.Hope this helps.

The 99% of people that do what they’re told question nothing and pass down what they know. This leads to a population that can’t think for themselves, to a dull, mechanical and mindless life.” - dan koeYour family, teachers and even the people you look up to will tell you to do the same thing that ended them in the same place - nowhere.Society, all of the societal and cultural information that your parents learned were passed down to them by their parents and then passed down to you and future generations.Societal information and all of the news and whatever that was circulating in the pasts were passed down to the children and then to you.And the cycle goes on as you are learning how to operate within the world that you are living in right now.What blows my mind is that this could be completely different.When you expose yourself to new information and change.Expose yourself to a renewal of mind and life.The point is that this default roadmap society hands to you send you like a train hurling down the tracks.And if you don’t learn to take your own path, then you may be heading towards a dead end.Many people are on the assembly line. Waiting to take off and land when society says so. A life on autopilot is a life half-lived.The societal script might have a beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks the most critical element: you.If there was no government, would we have any choice except be self governed?If there were no corps, would we have any choice except to figure out the right way to live?If there was no knowledge, would we have any choice except to be curious?If there were no teachers, would we have any choice except to be our own teacher?And if society had done it’s job properly, the worldwouldn’t be facing pandemics, wars, climate change,famines, droughts, floods and wildfires, unemployment,extreme inequalities, racism, colonialism, apartheid.We overestimate external authority, and underestimate our own intelligence.So if 95 plus percent of society is just on the assembly line, doing what they’re told, following the path that was laid out in front of them by society, then the majority of people that are the masses are leading us off the cliff into a ditch.That 95% is a lot of people, right?Copy paste is a great keyboard feature, and almost always a terrible way to build a great life.It is what it is. But we can work to change that through conscious self education.Too many people are going through life without any sense of who they truly are or what they want.This can go far enough that we even stop recognizing ourselves. We lose touch with who we really are.It is obvious to see today that those controlling society kept the truth from us so that they can control human behavior.They have done everything to be gatekeepers of information and the truth.With the decentralization of information, you have access to a massive database to feed your mind on the right type of information to alter the direction of your life.Think about it, there’s so much wisdom out there especially with the internet and all of the content we have access to.The internet has created flexible approach to work. The new age of remote work.There are new career paths. That instead of having about 50 limited jobs where you will be trained into a doctor, teacher, lawyer, pilot etc there has been an insane increase in the number of careers you can fit into.Which means that you don’t have to try to fit yourself into a job with preset boundaries.Where for example if you are a nurse you have to work a certain number of hours, Become a pilot you need to learn specific skills, And if you are a teacher you have a defined role.The internet has allowed anybody to follow their curiosity, pursue mastery and at the end of that there is a career that is perfectly suited to you.You are able to develop a career path that fits your lifestyle perfectly.You are directly in control of when you want to work, where you want to work and how much income you receive for the number of hours you put in the work.But how do you actually do this? How do you find a career path that pays you incredibly well and lets you do what you love well?The secret is to embrace the change, drown yourself in self education and pursue your life’s work.Which is no secret at all. Except I want it to sound like the golden nugget so that you will be pushed to take action that will completely change your life.Because change often seems hard even when we know it is good for a better life.Change is like jumping off a cliff and building your parachute on the way down.I like doing hard stuff.Not that I look for trouble or I don’t want an easy life. Who doesn’t?For me, the fastest way I have experienced massive growth is when I throw myself into the abyss.Learn, fail, iterate, fail, learn, win.I have learned so much from experience and personal development.Self improvement is underrated.If you are scared to break a few things and explore unknown territories you will never grow.A man is great not because he hasn’t failed. A man is great because failure hasn’t stopped him.A lot of people are stuck in life because of following a predefined path in life.If you are not renewing yourself, you are falling behind.Every day should feel a bit scary, because you are constantly challenging yourself with new experiences that cannot be overcome by the current you.Take advantage of the space that is available to you. The internet space is available to anyone who has a smartphone that can access the internet which includes you.I have a few questions for you:Are you giving your best with what you have, or are you waiting to have ‘enough’ before taking action?If you can’t afford premium apps, have you made the most of the free resources available to you?With a busy schedule as a student, parent, or full-time employee, what are you doing with the little 1-2 hours you have?

How are you using them?You might not have money for courses or masterclasses, but have you explored YouTube, Google, AI tools, free journals, etc.?If you make good use of the free resources, you might eventually afford premium experiences.If you keep misusing the little you have, even when you luckily get enough, you will still not make the most of it.The internet is the best thing to happen to this generation and you don’t have any excuse to be ignorant or unequipped.Ask yourself: Am I doing my best with what I have right now?If ‘No’, you know what to do." }, { "title": "how to turn your hobby into a profitable side hustle - turn passion into profit", "url": "/posts/how-to-turn-your-hobby-into-a-profitable-side-hustle-turn-passion-into-profit/", "categories": "Business, Digital Economy", "tags": "letters, business, digital economy", "date": "2024-02-17 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": " If you have solved a problem in your life, and other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it.In the digital economy, you don’t need a fancy credenti...", "content": " If you have solved a problem in your life, and other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it.In the digital economy, you don’t need a fancy credential or a prestigious degree.Your life experience is your qualification.Most people will spend 8 hours on someone else’sdreams for hours, hiding from their own.2 hours sit in traffic.16 hours a week, 24 hours of sleep.It doesn’t have to take 40 years. And a retirement plan to realize that a programmed life isn’t fulfilling.Work hard at your job and bring value BUT work harder on yourself.You are your best investment, invest accordingly.You do not not want to work, you want to work on something meaningful.To be independent, you need to break free from depending too much on others.Well I mean your job.Rely too heavily on pay check to pay check for your well-being, and it will hold you back.Build your own thing.Build something you are passionate about.Build what will last. It’s a process, but it’s a path that will make you self-reliant. “Since the invention of the plow, men have schemed ways to eat bread without walking behind one.” - Nick AllenThere’s a bunch of practical stuff for you.I want to take a moment to talk about your fear and to me this is really the heart of today’s letter.You have found your passion.You know that for example building digital products is what you really care about and you want to start something that you can call your own.But you’re afraid.Let me start by saying that nothing could be more normal than that.Every entrepreneur,every business owner,every artist, every self-starter has fear.In fact I think you’d be a little crazy not to be afraid of going or taking a chance on yourself.The Internet is your public resume. Your public portfolio.You have been using it wrongly: Excessive meme sharing Binge watching Netflix Mindless scrolling Posting snapsIt’s weekend after weekend until you wake up 5 years later with no savings, no investments, no house, no skills and no job.Just a gallery full of photo memories with people you don’t know where they went.Those who use the internet to share ideas, build businesses, and create life-changing products gain access to luck that 99% of the population isn’t aware of.An online side hustle is a flexible way to earn extra money by using your skills and interests.There are many options for online side hustles, depending on your goals: availability and experience. Note down your observation of what people are looking for.If there is a high demand for it, you have a gold mine to profit from. If you have solved a problem in your life, you’re qualified to start a side hustle.As much as you think people know everything you know, they don’t. Money is literally everywhere.All you need to do is find a problem people have that’s stopping them from progressing.Find a few solutions and then offer it to them.Providing you’re good at what you do, it’s impossible not to make money.Business is problem solving.You should be learning and testing new things out all the time.If you don’t you’ll fall behind.I started my first profitable side hustle when I identified that the company I worked with lacked the man power to meet the increasing demand for it’s services.I used Notion to develop a landing page that had a few copy about the business services, with a google form for taking applications.Pitched the idea to the CEO.I took a percentage on every successful hire.And I literally used free software. Just a laptop and internet.People care about themselves and the value you can deliver. Teach, entertain, show them the way.It’s your responsibility to package your offer in a way that others can profit from it.Create your own career that doesn’t depend on a capped paycheck.The future belongs to those who create their own careers through a wide range of synergistic skills.The age of the internet is the age of the entrepreneur.You can build an entertainment, education, or service based business around nearly any interest.You can create a profitable side hustle: Create a list of activities that interest you.Your side hustle should involve an activity that you enjoy so you can stay motivated and productive. Research the market and the demand.Before you invest your time and money into a side hustle, you should do some research to see if there is a need for your service or product, and who your potential customers are. Set realistic goals and expectations.A side hustle is not a get-rich-quick scheme, and it may take some time to see results so you should set SMART goals (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) and track your progress. Choose a platform or a website to showcase your work.Depending on your side hustle, you may need a platform or a website to promote your work and connect with customers. Social media is free. Facebook, X, LinkedIn, start with any of this. Market yourself and network with others.To grow your side hustle, you need to market yourself and your work to potential customers. You can use social media, email marketing, word-of-mouth, or other strategies to spread the word.You can also network with other side hustlers and learn from their experiences.On that note join our community of Builders, Creators and Side hustlers taking over the digital space.

To access new information you must experience new pains.“Knowledge is power”. If pain is information, then pain can be converted to power.To do so, you must learn to control your suffering, accept that scars are beautiful.If you felt pain, ask what information it gave you. If that information was useful, seek the next pain.You are learning.If you snap back to comfort and pleasure at the first hint of pain, your mind is programmed to rarely encounter meaning in life.You experience pain because you are going through a tough phase in life where your old self is gone, and your new self is still in the making.You’re in the middle of changing.You change who you are by gradually exposing yourself to – and digesting – new information with study and practice. The change will not be instant.I have been through some of the most painful events in my life.Businesses I started have failed.I made investments that became my loss.I have taken some steps in my life that have left physical scars.But those were learning moments for me.The human brain is a prediction machine.It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analysing the information it comes across.When something registers in your brain as pain, your mind will do everything to avoid it next time.All behaviour is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing\tpain and you want to relieve it.These are the three things that will guide you to turn pain into success.One is awareness.Become aware of the painIs it physical or emotional?Do you understand the complexity of the painAnd how it affects your life?Two is relevance.How relevant is it to your everyday life?What’s in it for you if you find the root cause?What are the potential benefits of solving it?Three is effort.How fast will you achieve the result?How can you solve the pain? is it throughEducation, entertainment or inspiration?And is that easy to achieve?Either way, the purpose of every action is to deal with the problems you face.Pain helps you to learn.Pain protects you from danger.Pain is the information you need to make better informed decisions.It is your personal feedback hub.Just because you feel bad doesn’t mean you should change your plan.Pain is a part of any worthwhile goal.Before SpaceX was successful, Elon Musk experienced three failed launches.“You have to learn those hard lessons.” ​”I messed up the first three launches, the first three launches failed. Fortunately the fourth launch – that was the last money that we had – the fourth launch worked, or that would have been it for SpaceX. But fate liked us that day,” said Elon Musk in 2017.Pain drives us to change more than motivation does.Most people do everything to avoid it by chasing cheap dopamine.Pain leads to growth.Nothing can stand in your growth if you turn your pain into fuel.Develop emotional control. Attain mental mastery. All pain, starts from the mindWhen you are in deep emotional pain there are only 2 things you can do Use it as rocket fuel for growth Let it consume you to the point of no returnThe choice is obviousYou don’t have to chase pain and problems, but you need to understand that you can’t avoid it. There will be times in your life that you will experience excruciating pain, but they will hurt less if you are aware that they’re supposed to be there.You need the pain of the lesson for the lesson to stick.Those pain points will shape your next course of action.And in the endThe pain will go away.The fruits of your labor will stay.Do not get addicted to escaping pain.Face your life.Handle your business and win.No battle was ever won by people who ran." }, { "title": "find inspiration in every day experiences - learn and grow", "url": "/posts/find-inspiration-in-everyday-experiences-learn-and-grow/", "categories": "Learning, Inspiration", "tags": "letters, curious, learning", "date": "2024-02-03 08:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "I had a curious mind growing up.I asked a lot of questions and I learnt a lot way beyond kids my age.Apart from that I was drawn to electronic gadgets.I was the kind of person you would call to fix...", "content": "I had a curious mind growing up.I asked a lot of questions and I learnt a lot way beyond kids my age.Apart from that I was drawn to electronic gadgets.I was the kind of person you would call to fix a broken radio or set the TV channel.I always wanted to know more.

Be assigned a program you aren’t interested in.Get a job.Spend 8 hours building someone else’s dreams and forget about your own. Retire at the ripe age of 60. When you have no time left and just enough money to survive (not thrive) until death.If you question nothing and do what you are told to do passed down by society, you will end up not being able to think for yourself.And you will blame the system for the mediocre life you end up in.Learning is the foundation of the human experience.

Those who cannot think for themselves are truly lost.Education should be a rewarding experience which allows you to think, imagine, question, doubt, and solve problems.We all got these big ideasOne day they’re replaced with fears.All these things we say we’ll get toShot down by the reasons not to.Don’t quit your dreams.The Internet has leveraged the playing field.You can write and sell a book without a publisher Make music without a record deal Auction your collection without a galleryQuit the mindless programming Learn different skills Explore different areas of life and career The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.The internet has created a divide in the economy. There’s the old economy which is made of college and corporations. This was the traditional way of doing things but it has a few problems.First, notice that for most degrees college isn’t the best way to gain information quickly. In college you have a lecturer that may be the best lecturer in your town or the city that you live in.On the internet however, you can listen to the best lecturer in the world. You can now get the best education quickly and for free using the internet.Corporations are so tightly structured. You have the top dog, the manager, the second layer of manager and then finally you have the employees. This creates a lot of inefficiency.Big corporations can get slow and as a result of this the old economy has split.Now we have the new economy. The new economy gives you unlimited access to online education.And instead of corporations we have the creator economy. This is a far more efficient system and it’s growing rapidly.Corporations and colleges are dipping and slowing down and getting smaller. The new economy is booming. The new economy rewards problem solvers, creative thinkers and high performers.If you have solved a problem in your life, And other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it.In the digital economy, you don’t need a fancy credential or a prestigious college degree.Your life experience is your qualification.Read a book – share what you learnListen to a podcast – share what you learnWatch a documentary – share what you learnHave a hard conversation – share what you learnBuild a business - share what you learnSide note, if you have the urge for more out of life join our community of creators, builders and side hustlers: nas.io/skillembassyI’ve met so many people who have the urge to build their own thing but have yet to start.If this is you, pls do yourself a favor.Build and learn along the way.It’s not the easiest way to start a business, but it is the best.The rate of feedback cycles from multiple sources a day will be massive.Iterate based on feedback.Stack experience.Stack results.Win at life.It’s your life that you’re makingFind out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you.

It’s necessary. You aren’t going to sit on an island and pay attention to nothing. The problem lies in your capacity for critical thought.According to seedscientific, the internet generates around 2.5 quintillion bytes of data every day. This includes everything from Facebook photos to data collected by the Curiosity Rover on Mars.It is estimated that the amount of data generated daily will increase from 97 zettabytes in 2022 to 181 zettabytes in 2025.That is a staggering figure to wrap my head around.Your brain processes an average of 74GB in information per day.That is the storage capacity of a standard smartphone.This is the life of the modern human.You don’t have clarity on how to achieve your ideal future.You feel that life is meaningless and bland. Your days are filled with responsibilities that aren’t important to you.You want to change your life but you cannot make quality decisions that will change the outcome you get everyday.A man who lacks the discipline to improve his social skills usually lacks the discipline to exercise his creative skills.And due to his lack of success, it manifests over and over again, creating a negative feedback loop.This is the majority of men aged 16-30 years old. The future men to improve this world.The world has many problems.But they aren’t going to be solved until you get your sh*t together.And it all starts with solving your attention problem.Some work requires a lot of deep thinking and focus.How can you work in a distracted environment where everyone is scrolling on their phone and switching tasks from social media to work to something else to doing what their impulses say.This is supposed to be a rhetorical question. But by now I am sure you have your answer in your own head.Stay away from distractions. Focus.The future belongs to the focused.You can’t be on social media 24/7 and expect to see results in your life.You should not allow the cancerous virus eat into your head and steal away valuable time.There are plenty of other things you can be working on at the same time.You can still go to the gym.You can still learn a skill.You can still focus on yourself.The internet and social media is a tool.Use it as such - like a tool.You wouldn’t use a hammer and keep it on you all day would you?Know what you want, get what you need, provide back to the community, and then log off social media and experience nature.The internet has many good stuff to offer you. I learnt how to built digital products just from the internet.Thank you Internet, you changed my life. Thank you God.There are many good uses of the internet. Stop mindless scrolling. learn a new skill online meet new amazing people promote your business give back to the community sell digital productsIf you are going to stay connected online do it intentionally.But you cannot keep wasting time consuming online without taking action.That gets you nowhere.Take back control of your life so you can find meaning, reinvent yourself, and create your ideal future.Become an independent thinker so you have the mental skill to navigate even the darkest moments of life.Take advantage of new opportunities because skills not learned in school are the source of income not found in employment.Maintain mental clarity so you don’t fall into a trench of negativity and continue attacking your goals.Most people are completely oblivious to where their attention is at any given time.You can’t learn to direct your attention until you’re aware of your attention in the first place.If what you are giving your attention to doesn’t make you money improve your skillset increase your social currency uplift your spiritBut rather empty your pockets leave you with zero knowledge make you isolated from your pack leave you demotivated and not in controlFocus your attention on the important stuff.If you’re serious about changing your life, you’ll find a way - if not, you’ll find an excuse.What does it mean to spend your time well?I’ve been thinking about how to spend my time well.I used to feel like little bits of my time kind of slip away from me,and when that happens, it feels like parts of my life are slipping away.Specifically, it feels like little bits of my time get slipped away to various things like this Facebook, Instagram, Twitter (X), Tiktok.You pull down to refresh on Facebook or X.But the thing is that 60 seconds later, you’ll pull down to refresh again.This doesn’t make any sense.The cost of your distraction from social media is that every time you get interrupted, it takes you about 23 minutes, on average, to refocus your attention.This actually trains bad habits. The more distractions you get from your mobile devices, it’s conditioning and training you to interrupt yourself.Instead of having constant mindless interruptions, you can create conscious interruptions.At least I have tried this and it’s helped me get almost half of my time back so that I can focus on the most important stuff.I have made sure my mobile device is set to focused mode each day at 7pm. This is how I block time to read and write.Recommended steps:Put restricted timing on each social media app through Digital Wellbeing option in your phone settings.Put your screen on greyscale after 10pm to give your eyes rest before sleep.Block time for social media to connect and contribute meaningful feedback and then log off.Prioritize reading over scrolling.Quit legacy media. It is an attention slot machine.The social media algorithm is trained to give you back what you consume.Start consuming useful information and your feed will start looking like a library of useful data.People you follow online are the information you consume. Pay attention to the people you follow on social media.That dictates the quality of the feed you read and the information you take in.I used to feel bad about not have exciting selfies and photoshoots to post about.Until I paid close attention.I realized I’m excited about: reading books writing about my life experiences travelling to quiet and humble placesGive yourself permission to enjoy the small things as your big things.Hope that helps.Talk soon!" }, { "title": "life transformation for those who self-educate", "url": "/posts/life-transformation-for-those-who-self-educate/", "categories": "Human Potential, Self-Education", "tags": "letters, curious, self-education", "date": "2024-01-20 07:00:00 +0000", "snippet": "One thing that I remember when I was growing up was that I loved reading.Not just reading.I was curious about life.

His extensive reading helps him think creatively and approach problems from various angles, contributing to his innovative ideas.He applied what he learned like a madman. (Well, he started multiple billion-dollar companies in different industries. How’s that for applying?)Elon Musk stated that he read for about 10 hours a day when he was younger.Some of the world’s richest men like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk cited reading as a key for their success.If you’re interested in a particular subject, read books, watch Youtube videos, take courses on related topics to broaden your knowledge and become intellectually curious about the world.Start with one.

We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.Meaningful change does not require radical change.Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big.That’s the paradox of making small improvements.Each time you get tiny results it teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself.You start to believe you can actually accomplish newer and more challenging tasks.Each time you practice a skill you are closer to becoming that person.Each time you write a page, you are a writer.Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.Each time you write a line of code you are a developer.The trick is not to do your best every day, the trick is to show up every day.Read a chapter every day.Write a page every day.Build something small every day.Be consistent.People who preach quality before they start anything are often just lazy.Quantity and iteration leads to real quality.High quantity leads to high quality.It took Thomas Edison the 1000th fail sequence to make the electric light bulb.This is the feedback loop behind all human success:try,fail,learn,try differently.Thank you for reading and enjoy the weekend.Sign up to receive weekly dose of fresh content in your inbox every Saturday." }, { "title": "Do You Make These Happiness Mistakes?

Sometimes we wish for these things for ourselves because we believe that these folks are happy with their lives.We tend to define happiness more in terms of what we see than in terms of who we are. In the end, we define our own happiness in terms of how other people live their lives.It doesn’t stop there, though; we go farther and define other people’s happiness in terms of what we have come to accept as a good life.So what happens is that we start judging someone’s happiness based solely on what we see, forgetting that happiness is a condition that is unique to each individual.While some people have little and are happy, others have a lot and are unhappy.Abundance creates comfort and not necessarily happiness. Let us be thankful that what is most needful and useful, generally is most cheap and common. Though men value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in a time of famine they willingly barter them for bread.What is happiness? City life? Bright lights?Perhaps it is, perhaps not!Is the village boy who strived to leave the village behind for the bright city life happy?Or is it the city boy who finds love in the dull slow paced village that finds happiness?Who is to judge if not the very person that strives for his own definition of happiness?We cannot account for all that we have as happiness and discount other people as unhappy because we think they lack what we have.However, just because you don’t require much to be happy doesn’t mean you should settle for the absolute minimum.Live life to the fullest and always seek to improve yourself." }, { "title": "7 Ways To Make Conversation With Anyone", "url": "/posts/seven-ways-to-make-conversation-with-anyone/", "categories": "Communication, Psychology", "tags": "rapport, conversation", "date": "2023-12-16 20:30:01 +0000", "snippet": "Talking to new people might seem like a lot of work, but I’ve got some easy tricks to help you out.You see, strangers can bring awesome opportunities.Each person brings a new experience, an opportu...", "content": "Talking to new people might seem like a lot of work, but I’ve got some easy tricks to help you out.You see, strangers can bring awesome opportunities.Each person brings a new experience, an opportunity to learn something new, experience something different, or hear a story you’ve never heard before.Imagine you’re in a room, and you spot someone you want to talk to. You feel the first word on your lips, but it’s stuck somewhere in your throat. You are shy. Don’t worry, just say it!Start with a Simple HelloImagine the first word as a gate.Once you open it with a simple greeting like “hi” or “hello,” everything else flows more smoothly.Put on a big smile and say hi! Don’t hesitate.If you are reading this by that person stick your hand out, and say hello.Forget the boring “hi, how are you” routine.It’s a time waster. Instead, ask a personal question.People love sharing, trust me!Instead of asking what’s up, try something unique like: How did you get that interesting tatoo? Or, do you remember the first day you came to this city?Personal questions lead to cool stories.Answers to those questions are always something unique, always something personal.Make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person might have in common.When you start at that point and then move outward from there, you will find that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier and that’s because both of you are suddenly on the same side of something.Starting with something in common is like having a secret handshake. It instantly makes conversations easier. Maybe you both like the same band, are from the same place, or share a love for the same soccer team.Finding that “me too” moment is like finding a treasure.Make people feel great by saying something special. Skip the usual words like nice, awesome, or cool. Be unique.Try saying something like, “I love how your smile makes your whole face light up!” You’ll be memorable for sure.Everyone has an opinion. So ask about something simple, like their favorite coffee or the last movie they watched. Listen carefully to what they say. It’s like playing catch with ideas.All of us have opinions trust me. But we all want them to be heard and everybody wants validation so go on and ask for an opinion.It opens up a two way street, that’s when the real communication begins and you will be surprised how much you can pick up about a person just by asking their opinion on something pretty generic.When you talk to someone, be all there. No multitasking. Look them in the eyes, and they’ll know you’re really listening. Eye contact is like a magic spell for connection.Remember the little details about a person.When you meet someone, remember their name.It’s like a secret code to their heart. And don’t forget other stuff they tell you. It shows you care. You could even ask about their pets or remember their favorite places.Great reading!

You’ll attempt to compare your life to others’, or people will try to persuade you to live the way they do.You must find your own route, your own method of doing things that works for you. If we listen to the voices that contradict who we want to be, we may never be able to settle.Cut all toxic people out of your lifeDo not welcome toxic people back into your life, no matter how lonely you get on your path. Engaging with toxic people saps your motivation, passion, purpose, and sense of meaning in life.Get in some form of exercise every dayThere is now widespread agreement on the value of physical exercise.From elementary school to university, we were taught the importance of exercise. And sometimes you don’t just need it for your body; you also need it to cleanse your thoughts.Get a gym membership, or make it a habit to jog, walk, perform yoga, or conduct your own aerobic exercise at home on a regular basis.Maintain the health of your body and mind.Learn how to calm yourself in tough situationsWe are all likely to face some form of difficult situation in our lives and how we comport ourselves will speak volume about how we will deal with other people.Stop procrastinatingThe thing is that you keep saying you’ll start from tomorrow, but if you really wanted it, you’d start now.Set goals, form habits, and pursue them, and you will make history.Procrastination leads to stagnation when it comes to your personal and professional relationships.Don’t put it off, and don’t do it later. You will stagnate if you procrastinate.Find a job you love, not one that just pays the billsWhen the love for mankind (service) and the passion for a product (solution) combine, the desire to get up every morning to work is always fresh.Love what you do because of what you can accomplish for people. Love for service and love for a solution; that’s what brings out the passion.We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on thatFind out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you.Take small steps toward it every day, and set aside the larger vision for a time.For the time being, follow your curiosity; if you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.Rid yourself of negative self talkTake charge of who you are and what you want for yourself.Stop downplaying what you care about and your hopes. Take control of your desires, ideas, and perceptions. Own your fire. Own your no-saying and yes-saying. Take charge of your emotions and mood. Take charge of your plans, your path, and your success. Almost every successful person begins with two convictions: the future can be better than the present, and I have the ability to make it so.Surround yourself with like minded peopleA lot of things also come down to identity, right? Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible.Therefore make sure the people you move with share similar visions and goals with you.Otherwise you will lose your sense of purpose and get distracted towards your goals and journey to a better version of yourself.Get outside at least 20 mins a dayCreativity is sparked by adventure.Get outside and live life.Speak to someone, open yourself to new adventures and you’d be surprised the good things that can come out of it.Read on a topic that interest you that you don’t know much aboutGeorge R.R. Martin once said, “I have lived a thousand lives and I have loved a thousand loves. I’ve walked on distant worlds and seen the end of time. Because I read.”It is enjoyable, inexpensive, and beneficial to read books.A single large book will keep you entertained for several hours, as well as prompt you to analyze and reassess certain aspects of the world around you. And, what’s more, you can get that one book for almost nothing.If you have the time and resources get a petDogs are often referred to as man’s best friend, but they aren’t the only creatures who have a special place in humanity’s heart.Having a pet may help you deal with loneliness, decrease stress, enhance your mental health, and provide you with a chance to meet new people.If you are someone who is thinking of having or raising your own family, that’s one way to start from.Drastically reduce your time on social mediaWe are unaware of many mental processes that occur when we spend time on social media.What is genuine and truthful in our story becomes clouded.We don’t consciously think about it, yet it happens all the time.It may mostly influence our confidence and self-worth, especially if we start comparing our lives to those we see on social media, which are frequently not as they appear.Spend more time with family and friends, and embark on adventures. Those are the approaches to live a genuine life.Quit comparing yourself to othersDon’t compare your beginning to the middle of someone else’s life. Don’t compare your first chapter to someone else’s 20th.Everyone began somewhere, so get out there and begin.If you are in a toxic, abusive relationship, leaveA toxic relationship leaves you feeling unsupported, misunderstood, disparaged, or abused.On the most basic level, any relationship that makes you feel worse rather than better over time can become toxic.Toxic relationships can exist in a variety of settings, from the schoolyard to the workplace to the bedroom.It is not your job to fix an abuser, it not your job to love someone who doesn’t want to be loved and it is not your job to change anyone who is not ready for change.Remove yourself from any relationship that doesn’t make you feel valued.Start changing slowly, take baby steps. Slow but steady progressThere’s nothing more attractive than someone who knows exactly what they want and are dedicated to get it.Make this shift in your life. Start with baby steps as you grow into the person you want to become.Just as the saying goes, “Dream big and Start small.”Quit trying to find love, do the above and love will find youThe goose chase for love is crazy and never ending. Live your best life, be yourself and you will meet someone who can connect with the true you." }, { "title": "Pivot Don't Quit - Highligthing A crucial point in Entreprenership", "url": "/posts/pivot-dont-quit-a-crucial-point-in-entrepreneurship/", "categories": "Progress, Management", "tags": "business, entrepreneur, management", "date": "2023-12-15 07:40:00 +0000", "snippet": "Google has a graveyard of failed projects.Some of these projects cost them, tens of millions of dollars and eventually got shut down e.g. Google+, Google Print or Google Hangouts.

Either way, you win.4. “I Wish I had stayed in Touch with my Friends”There were many deep regrets about not giving friendships the time and effort that they deserved.Ware states, “Often they would not truly realize the full benefits of friends until their dying weeks and it was not always possible to track them down.”Figure out who matter most to you in life, and make sure you have them by your side.5. “I Wish I had let myself be Happier”Happiness is a choice rather than a consequence of situations. It is important we make choices based on our happiness and not our fears.Ware expressed, “Fear of change had them pretending to others and to themselves that they were content, when deep within, they longed to laugh properly.”Fear is the only thing that holds us back from experiencing happiness and appreciating life to the fullest.Do not leave room for regret in your last days.Act on your choices and be as happy as you wish to be.In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take." }, { "title": "How Hackers Try To Get Access To Your Account Through Phishing and Social Engineering", "url": "/posts/how-hackers-try-to-get-into-your-account/", "categories": "Cybersecuity, Hacking", "tags": "cybersecurity, hacking, social engineering, phishing", "date": "2023-09-04 01:35:00 +0000", "snippet": "Welcome to this short course that will help you stay safe on the internetPeople spend a lot of time online either to consume or create content, keep in touch with family and friends or entertain th...", "content": "Welcome to this short course that will help you stay safe on the internetPeople spend a lot of time online either to consume or create content, keep in touch with family and friends or entertain themselves. Business activites are also conducted over the internet everyday. So the internet has become part of our normal daily lives.Day in and day out, hackers try many ways to get access to your personal information or critical information of your business or customers. If one method fails, they resort to other methods.After completing the Google Cybersecurity course, I became more aware of the different offensive attacks that goes on day to day on the internet.So let’s walk through a practical way of keeping safe online. Stay through to the end because I will tools and resources that will also help you to be more aware and how to stay safe online.Social EngineeringThis is an example of an approach someone can use to get you to give them your personal information like email and password. Here’s an example of a typical phishing message which contains a link which appears to be from Facebook.In this account someone sends a message through messenger telling me my account will be disabled. The hacker adds a link that i should click for verification.Check for emails in your mail boxThe first red flag is that I didn’t receive any email from Facebook. For important information like this, it is likely the company your account is connected will send you an email which is registered with the user. One of the safe ways to check if a site may contain or lead to harmful application is to hover your mouse cursor on the link and preview itBecause I am investigating this I went ahead to click the link. In your case, as soon as you identify a link to be harmful delete immediatelyUsually some the things that will give out a suspicious attack are mispellings or wrongful information.Check for grammatical errorsLet’s investigate this message well.You’ll notice a grammatical error here… Confirm your account within the next 24 hours otherwise our your Page may …Additionally the url has some misspellings in it.Further with our investigation if click the continue button another page shows. This is where the data extraction will occur. Here’s a quick game from Google to help you identify phishing attacks and stafe on the internetThe moment you put in your email and password the hacker is going to collect these information and use it to access your account.Sometimes they will change your password after they have login to your account so that you lose complete access.Congratulations!!

The Captsone project gives one the opportunity to put their project management knowledge and skills to the test in a real-world simulation. I will be Peta, the Project Manager for this project.OverviewSauce and Spoon, a small restaurant company, is trying to reach its annual expansion and growth targets. They’ve chosen to undertake a trial project to see how well new tabletop menu tablets will help them achieve these objectives. The new menu tablets will help Sauce and Spoon fulfill its business goals by allowing the restaurant to serve more clients in less time. They will also provide useful statistics.As the company’s first in-house project manager, I was tasked to handle the tablet rollout at two of the five restaurants in the company. Throughout you’ll see how I lead the team through the process of planning and completing project deliverables.You’ll be able to follow the project throughout its life cycle as I learn about the restaurant industry, establish project goals, negotiate with stakeholders, and much more.You’ll see how I learned what works and what doesn’t, as well as how to problem solve my way through the project, practice key project management concepts like analyzing materials to identify project requirements, solve problems, and manage stakeholders, using important negotiation and influencing techniques, listening with empathy when working with a team, and practicing stakeholder communication skills.Are you ready? Let’s go. View all quiz results at the repository hereProject CharterA project charter is a formal document that clearly defines the project and outlines the necessary details to reach the project’s goals.Part of my roles was to draw a project charter.The project charter contains the project scope, costs, and benefits to the project. This will later help me identify aspects of the project as being out-of-scope and add it to the charter.The charter helps to lay out project goals, highlight benefits, and help keep stakeholders aligned.I completed the project charter for my peers to review the completed project charter and provide feedback on each section.Project CharterRequest Access to ViewInfluential EmailA coalition is a temporary alliance or partnering of individuals or groups in order to achieve a common purpose or to engage in a joint activity.Omar, the owner of Sauce &amp; Spoon, has requested that we expand the tablet rollout to include all dining sections, not just the bar. Deanna expects Peta to do what she can to accommodate an expansion, but Peta feels it is outside the scope of the project. However, because Omar is the owner and a senior stakeholder, Peta decides to get input from other team members. She hopes to identify at least two team members who will support her position on keeping the rollout confined to the bar area. Peta meets with Gilly, Alex, Larissa, Zane, Seydou, and Carter to discuss the pros and cons of expanding the tablet rollout.Writing Influential EmailsRequest Access to ViewProject PlanThe planning phase of a project involves the schedule, the budget, risk management.Project PlanRequest Access to ViewSurvey QuestionsPeta has created evaluation questions and indicators to measure customer satisfaction during the test launchSurvey QuestionsRequest Access to ViewProject Evaluation and FindingsThe test launch is complete and the team has compiled the survey results.
