<!-- I remember travelling into London with my mum and brother when I was about 14 or 15 years old. When we got into London, not far from islington/highbury area, the traffic was slow but flowing with a stop start rhythm. As we were gradually edging towards the front of a queue that was caused by a set of traffic lights, a beautiful girl that was sitting and waiting at a bus stop to the left of me caught my eye. I couldn't help but stare at her as she sat there and gaze towards the sky, in her own world. Looking at her I could see that her carefree head was in the clouds just watching the day go past.

She then turned her head and noticed me staring at her, we made eye contact. As we paused in that brief but beautiful moment, eyes locked looking at one another, we shared a beautiful subtle smile before breaking into a full on contagious beaming smile, as if we were good friends sharing a private joke and all the passersby were none the wiser.

 I thought "wow look how beautiful she is and what a gorgeous smile" and then blushingly I turned my gaze away, not wanting to make it awkward for myself nor her.

Then I thought to myself "Hold on! Was that?!"

I snapped my neck back and realised, Yes! it was indeed Amy Winehouse! She started laughing realising that I had processed, computed and only just clocked on.

I exclaimed to my brother "look!! that's Amy Winehouse there!"  He was more focused on the road and the lights up ahead as they began to change green he didnt believe me anyway.  

As the car started moving I quickly put my windows down and shouted "AMY!!" She looked and was laughing even harder and then I knew without doubt it was her.

The cars moved off and my moment with her had passed.

I still think of that moment, especially when I go into London, as I usually go past the exact same spot. I think what if I would have got out the car and just took my shot at striking a conversation with her. Just to connect with another human and interact before going on about our days and lives.

She had a beautiful smile. And I can still picture her in that moment. -->
