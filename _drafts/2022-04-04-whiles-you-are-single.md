As I prepare for my King, I have become intentional and mindful of the need to develop myself as woman. Some of the ways in which I have embraced this singlehood is through; personal and professional development.

I take advantage of several opportunities. I am aware that when I get married and become a mother, there are things I wouldn't be able to do, therefore, NOW in my singlehood, I take advantage or anything and everything morally right.

I have used my singlehood to effectively contribute to my community, through the establishment of my grassroots initiative Power of Love Foundation Canada.

Dear Ladies, please don't spend your singlehood lamenting and questioning God on why your Boaz or Bae isnt here yet. Work on yourself, be the best version of yourself. Seek professional development. Make money--men are not an ATM
