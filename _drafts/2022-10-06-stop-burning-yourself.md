Making mistakes is part of being human. We all make them from time to time, and hopefully each mistake is a learning opportunity. We look at what happened and try to understand why it did to avoid it in the future. Think of a toddler learning the stove is hot. They touch it once and it burns them. They quickly learn that touching the stove hurts, so they stop doing it. It's important that we're able to learn from our mistakes or else we'd constantly be burning ourselves
