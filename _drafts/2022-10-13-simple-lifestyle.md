My top 5. And it’s taken me a lifetime to grow my life simpler.

## 1. What do you truly want?

Many people never take the time to ask themselves that question. They don’t know what will bring them happiness so they try to fill up their lives with more and more stuff which will never bring it. Instead, ask yourself that question. And take the time to write down the answers. Then focus on that each day and it will simplify your life.

## 2. What do you truly need?

Many people get that question confused with what things they think they want. So they chase the things and never find their happiness. Instead, ask yourself that question. Then when you’re making decisions about what to buy ask if this is what you truly need. Fulfilling your needs, honestly, is way more simple than fulfilling all of your wants.

## 3. What do you already have?

Many people continually want more. Whatever they buy soon they grow tired of and want something more. Only to find the newness of it wears off too. Instead, think about what you already have and give gratitude for it. It will cause you to appreciate it more and seek less which is much simpler.

## 4. Who will you truly share it with?

Many people give up relationships seeking new ones or to make more money to spend on stuff. Then discover the new wasn’t as good. Instead, focus bringing with you the ones you love. Love brings happiness in a way stuff simply can’t. So seek happiness where you can truly find it. It’s simpler.

## 5. When will you enjoy it?

Many people spend their lives always chasing more. And at the end have little to show for it and miss finding the happiness they wanted. Instead, focus on discovering happiness in the moments of your journey shared with those you love. Enjoy life moment by moment. Needing little more and missing little else. Discovering joy in simple.

And you’ll be surprised by the happiness you dream of wrapped in the gift of a simple lifestyle.
