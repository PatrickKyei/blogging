## Never follow the crowd

Set YOUR goals, own them and pursue them.
Don't take your dreams to the grave!

## Embrace change

Change is a part of life.
Disrupt yourself BEFORE change disrupts you.

## Live outside your comfort zone

Your comfort zone is your DEATH zone.
Everything you want lies on the edge of your comfort zone.

## Pursue knowledge

The moment you stop LEARNING, you stop growing.
When we stop growing, we start dying.

## Choose your relationships wisely

We become like the people we spend the most time with.

Remember, eagles don't fly with pigeons.
