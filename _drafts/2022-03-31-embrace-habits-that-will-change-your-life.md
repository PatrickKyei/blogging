## Never follow the crowd

Set YOUR goals, own them and pursue them.
Don't take your dreams to the grave!

## Embrace change

Change is part of Life.
DISRUPT YOURSELF BEFORE YOU ARE DISRUPTED BY CHANGE.

## Live outside your comfort zone

Your DEATH ZONE is your comfort zone.
Everything you desire lies on the other side of your comfort zone.

## Pursue knowledge

You can't grow if you don't continue to LEARN.
We begin to die when we cease growing.

## Choose your relationships wisely

We become the people with whom we spend the most time.

Bear in mind that eagles do not fly with pigeons.
