## The science of motivation

So one of the things that we know about the most productive people is that they tend to perceive choices where others see just chores

Because we know that your ability to motivate, to do hard tasks, that's something that the most productive people have in spades

And the way that they do that, the way that they motivate for that is that they look for choices where others might not perceive them.

People who look for some type of choice they can make right away that helps them get motivated to start. So if someone says like, "Hey, can you have lunch tomorrow?" Typing as your first sentence, "I'd love to have lunch, but I'd like us to have Indian food," or "Can you meet tomorrow at 11 o'clock?" "Sure, I can meet you at 11 o'clock, but I'm only going to stay for 20 minutes. I got to be out of there by 11:20." By making a choice that makes you feel in control, it's much easier to activate those parts of your neurology, where motivation resides. And that works really well for small tasks, right? Turn a chore into a choice, and it's easier to get that chore. The other thing that really productive people do is that they understand that the way to motivate themselves for long-term tasks is to force themselves to ask why. Why am I doing this thing?

Well, so it's interesting. I mean, so I have an eight-year-old and a five-year-old and we work really hard to do a couple things. First of all, to teach them to see choices so that if my son comes in and he says, "I'm bored." The first thing I say is, "Well, I want you to tell me three things you could do right now. And then tell me which one you want to choose to do," right? Not solving his problem for him, but teaching him to see choices. But then the other important thing with other people is how we praise them. And a lot of this goes back to a researcher named Carol Dweck who's worked on this concept of internal locus of control, and what's known as a growth mindset.

So one of the things that Carol says is when your kid comes home and they got an A on a paper. The wrong thing to say is, "You know what, I'm so proud of you, you are so smart," because what you're teaching them is that they have an innate quality. Something outside of their control that determined whether they did well on that exam or not. The thing that you ought to say to them is, "I'm so proud of you. You worked so hard to get that A." Because what you're reinforcing is you actually have control over whether you got that A. You made a choice to work hard and it paid off in a good grade. We can train our children, our spouses, ourselves, or coworkers. We can train them to see these opportunities for control that they have and in doing so we help them motivate to get things done.

o we help show other people that they have a choice by essentially using a little bit of a light version of the Socratic method, depending on how old they are, it sounds like.
