You called me from the room in your hotel   
All full of romance for someone that you'd met  
And telling me how sorry you were leaving so soon  
And that you'll miss me sometimes when you're alone in your room  

Do I feel lonely too?

You have no right to ask me how I feel  
You have no right to speak to me so kind  
I can't go on, just holding on to time
Now we're living separate lives  

Well, I have learned to let you go  
And if you lost your love for me, you never let it show  
There was no way to compromise  
So now we're living, now we're living separate lives  

Ooh, it's so difficult, love lead to isolation  
So you build that wall, you build that wall  
Yes, you build that wall, oh yes, you build that wall  
And make it stronger

You have no right to ask me how I feel  
You have no right to speak to me so kind  
Some day I might  
I might find myself looking in your eyes  
But for now, we'll go on living separate lives  

Yes for now, we'll go on living separate lives
