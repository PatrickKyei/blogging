## Renew your goals with a daily reminder



## Have a goal

No matter what you want to get better at, you need to have a clear vision of what it is you want to accomplish.

Once I was in a bookstore and decided to get a unique writing pad. I kept looking and didn’t like anything I saw. Then I realized that I was looking for a writing pad without knowing what kind I actually wanted.

A person with no goals is like a ship with no direction in the sea; it will never reach its destination.

## Motivation

Why do you want what you want? The clearer you can answer this question, the more driven you will be to improve your skills and achieve your goals.

## Analyze your mistakes

The world is full of people who want to get better at something. But they aren’t doing anything for that. Analyzing your mistakes is a shortcut to your goals. Don’t overanalyze, though

## Have a success journal


Seeing your accomplishments (no matter how small) in written form will inspire you and boost your confidence.

## Find experts

Would you ask an engineer how to make better pizza? Would you ask a car mechanic for advice on investing? Sadly, this is what many do: asking advice from non-experts.

Ask someone who has walked your path and succeeded. Surround yourself with people smarter than you.

## Observe

Want to become a better basketball player? Watch more skilled players play. How do they play so good? How do they get better? Pick up their traits.

## Act


You can spend years learning how to fly. But if you’ve never flown a plane, you’ll never become a pilot.
