Waking up early - it is half the battle. But more importantly, waking up at the same time everyday. Routine and scheduling is key

A big breakfast - full of fat and protein. 30 grams within 30 minutes of waking is a good guide.
Water - 500 mili litres of water or more, plus coffee.
Plan for the day - writing it down is crucial. This will be slightly different everyday.

Execute - self-explanatory. This will be slightly different everyday. Although some days will involve more time meeting people face-to-face, or on the phone.

Read - daily. Reading is an investment. Re-reading some of these books every now and then - Best investment books for beginners

Planning for next day - at the end of every day
