## Networking

That scientifically happiness can be a choice. And once you make that choice, it proves to be a great advantage in terms of our relationships, because positive people are perceived as being more attractive by the opposite sex. They're perceived as being more trustworthy in social situations and within sales. We find that they're more likely to receive promotions. We find that they're actually more likely to live longer. It turns out that as people make that choice, the effect spreads not only to them, but to the people around them, causing them to be happy as well.

Happy is contagious. 

Let me tell you one really cool thing. They're called mirror neurons. We just discovered them in the human brain a little while ago, but basically if you see somebody yawn and then other people in the room start yawning. There's a biological reason for that. There are certain parts of your brain that activate when you see people around you yawn or smile. And as a result of that, they light up, they show activation in your brain telling you that you're the one that's yawning. You're the one that's smiling. And you can pick up the fatigue of somebody sitting across the room. You can actually pick up the smile of somebody that's talking to you.
[00:16:02] Where this gets interesting is, we found if you have 15 strangers waiting for a plane and they don't even know they're part of an experiment and you have an undercover researcher come near them and just act anxious. They tap their foot on the floor. They move side to side. They look at their watch repeatedly with a frown on their face. And within just two minutes, we found that seven to 12 of the 15 individuals were unconsciously started moving nervously in place or tapping their foot on the ground and/or looking at their watch more than four times in two minutes. 

[00:16:31] Which shows the reason for that experiment and why I'm telling you about these mirror neurons is because there's a biological reason for the emotional contagion. That you can be an incredibly optimistic person, but you can pick up the negativity of people around you, like secondhand smoke. Because it's not just smiles and yawns that spread, but it turns out if you're surrounded by people that are focused on the negative or anxious or are down all the time, it turns out even if you're an optimist, you'll start to pick that up. 
[00:16:59] Now, when I tell people about that, they immediately start cutting negative people out of their lives. But I think that this research is so much more powerful for you and for the people listening, because what this research shows is that when we choose to become more positive, when we create a positive habit in our lives and buffer ourselves against the negative, we can actually wirelessly change the brains of people around us, causing them to become more positive and actually trumping that negative effect. So the real question is can we get ourselves to become positive enough so that we can actually overcome the negative influences that are around us. 

Instead of having to eliminate negative people from our lives, we can actually become stronger than them by creating some of these positive changes, creating these positive habits with our lives. So we've been studying a positive psychology. We can actually trump their negative effect.


The key, I think though, is once people hear about positive research, they go guns blazing at the most negative person that they know, trying to change that person. 

And I think a much better strategy based upon this research is to go for the low hanging fruit, go for those people in our lives that are neutral, or it could be tipped in one direction or the other. And once we've actually moved them to become more positive, we've increased the number of people being positive around that negative person. In social influence and social psychology, which you probably know. Three things, it's the strength of the message, it's how immediate the message is, and the number of sources. If you can increase the number of positive sources around that negative person, you've actually dramatically increased your social influence over them, allowing them to start to make some of these positive changes.

But that means that a third of the people that, that optimist is talking to, there's a third of a chance â€” I mean, 30 percent chance that the person they're talking to that doesn't seem very positive is actually an optimist but is not being expressive of it right now. The more people that choose to be verbally and non-verbally expressive of their optimism at work, it changes the social script, allowing, unlocking those 31 percent to actually feel like they can be more optimistic. And that they don't have to keep going along with the grumbling or the complaining.

Excellent. Wow. So I want to jump back to something you'd mentioned earlier as well, where you'd sort of hinted at this, that happiness begets success, not the other way around. You'd mentioned it, I think in a sales context. And I totally understand that, but I want to clarify that. So which comes first happiness or success? Because I know from my wall street days, everybody talked about success coming first, but I also know that that was the most back ass words place that I've ever been in my life. And I never want to go back. 

The second one is something called the doubler. I went through two years of depression when I was at Harvard and this is the one that pulled me out of it. What we have people do is think of one positive experience you've had over the past 24 hours. One positive experience and then into a blank word document, into an app, into a Moleskine, whatever you want to do, you just bullet point every detail you can remember about that one experience. So you're not journaling about your whole day. You're just writing about the one experience, what you were wearing, what you're thinking about, what you're saying. 
[00:32:19] The reason for that is your brain can't tell the difference between visualization and actual experience. So if you journal about a positive experience, your brain doubles it for you. Do it for 21 days, your brain actually realizes it. It connects the dots for you. And you realize this, you have this trajectory of meaning running throughout your life. It's the fastest intervention we found for raising the level of meaning people feel within their life.
