Take bold action towards your intuition — uncomfortable yet so fulfilling.

Talk to people you find interesting — drop the “I am an introvert” label.

When something bad happens — don’t react but decide a specific action step you will take to better it.

Whatever you are doing in life — accept failure as part of the process. It’s not a disappointment.

Have something meaningful to work towards — get that delayed gratification for focused work.

Use your attention wisely — don’t give it to negative content.

Cut out people that drain your energy — you aren’t obligated to do anything.

Treat yourself with respect — take care of your health, style, etc.

Kill the need to please people, be yourself — it will take a while.

Never stop doing uncomfortable things — get in the habit of being spontaneous.
