if you're deliberately thinking about your relationships long before anybody you are on the right way. else Your age is when you're 16 17 18 most people aren't being thoughtful about who they spend time with or how often they reach out or how they can consciously go deep in their connections.

I certainly wasn't. Like most young adults, they're just defaulting to their existing ties. Settling for people and goals that present themselves rather than seeking out the ones they really want. And that's fine, we all go through that phase. I went through that phase, it's just part of being a kid.

But your way ahead now, you have to change the game. You have to be deliberate who you connect to, taking it seriously those that that you allow in your space. 

So my advice is this; keeps staying in touch with people. Don't give up on them entirely. But also have some patience while those in your friends zone catch up. They probably haven't woken up to the power of great relationships. 

And by the way this isn't a teenage problem. There are people in ther 40s and 50s who don't understand these stuff are important. You'll always encounter people who just don't understand that relationships are everything. So while you keep up your relationships prioritize the people who reciprocate your investment follow the good vibes man if nine out of 10 people your age don't really engage but one of them does and you feel a connection that's a win stick with that person a handful of close meaningful relationships it's always better than a hundred week ones and I would start focusing on people who are older than you seek out people in their 20s 30s even their 40s older smart people who get it they love hearing from curious hard working young people like you for the next five or 10 years you might have more luck with older people which is actually a huge asset when it comes time to look for a job or launch a project or plan a cool trip or whatever those people will be clutch and you have a lot to offer them too I'm sure so just keep respect of my young friend I know this is a little annoying but it is actually a good sign and if you're listening right now and you're wondering if it's too soon to start building your relationship seriously whether you're 16 26 36 doesn't matter this young woman is a great model it is never too early it's never too late just start it's so easy you can check out our 6 minute networking course the course is free on the thinkific platform
