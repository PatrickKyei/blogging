As the usage of technology grows by the day, so does the demand for user experience (UX) designers. UI/UX designers are concerned with how users interact with things such as websites, applications, and physical items. Everyday encounters are made more helpful, pleasant, and accessible by UX designers. That is why businesses of all sizes and in a variety of sectors require the services of UX designers. I am thrilled to walk through this journey to become a better UX designer, as I gain the skills necessary to launch a career/product in today's most demand to technology products.
