I figure there'd no be better person to tell the story than myself.

I stopped trying to I wouldn't become the barrier to her happiness. I wanted her for myself but it didn't mean I should fight against her happiness. I stopped calling often. _Add more text_

I listened and did exactly what she wanted. I figured it's better and peaceful to treat people the way they want to be treated. It's the reason why there's a new Sunshine in my life.

I had to see the sun settle peaceful so that I can appreciate a new day. 

When a man hits rock bottom, the only way is up. So I will keep going forward and upwards. Good luck to me and all the best!
