We simply express the experiences, whether they were the finest or not because life can be a wonderful battle, dude. Let's just have fun with this. Make the best of it. And now I'll go right to the point. I want to win, and I want to win big. Not only should you win, but you should win large.

Without a doubt you don't have the same ambition that you had when you were younger. Obviously you have adult ambition now. You're not just like galavanting up the streets or whatever. It's a completely different and more ambitious game.

The process is what makes you able to enjoy and manage success. The example I thought of is like, without the process, you're like that lottery winner who's like, "Oh, I have $10 million now." And then in two, three, five years, they're broke.

You say that success is based on what you do when no one is looking and you build one brick at a time. That is probably one of the most important. And one of the most overlooked bits of advice that I think a lot of people who are trying to make it think of. Like, they're really doing everything in front of the camera and when the camera's off, there's a lot of like, "Well, I'm done now because I posted it," or, "I'm done now because the video is out. I'm done now."

You will most definitely be because everything that matters you have to take advantage of your time. Time is the most valuable asset you will ever have control of. So you have to take advantage of it right now.

How do you decide which habits or activities or people that you need to cut out? Because not everything is going to be aimed towards your goals. Like sometimes you just have friends, but I assume you've got a rule of thumb for this kind of thing.
