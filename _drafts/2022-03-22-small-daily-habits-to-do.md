Daily habit 

## 1. Fill your mind with relevant facts

The information you feed your brain has an impact on how you think and how you see life in general. As technology advances and information becomes more readily available, it is becoming more common to encounter bad and biased news. Continuous and excessive exposure to negative and skewed information will have an impact on your decision-making process and the quality of your decisions.

As a result, it's critical to filter the news you get and how you absorb information. At the very least, you should have more than three news sources from which to choose your news. This might assist you in double-checking the facts in your newsfeed so that you can make an informed decision if the various news sources contradict one other.

## 2. Improve your focus each morning by asking yourself, "What is the ONE thing I am dedicated to learning today?"

This habit simplifies things, improves brain focus, encourages you to prioritize your goals, and streamlines your task so you don't easily become overwhelmed by a thousand things you "have" to complete. Put it on a piece of paper in huge, strong characters and put it on your bedroom or bathroom wall? Save it to your to-do list or set a reminder for it? While brushing your teeth or getting ready, read it aloud and come up with a answer on the spot. Then, while you go about your day, keep it in mind as a reminder of what you've committed to accomplish.

## 3. Early on, engage your most important tasks.

Deep work can be any kind of analytical thinking that requires the most concentration such as reading, writing, analyzing or problem solving. It requires a different kind of focus from other more tactical things we do on a regular basis, from washing dishes to setting our alarm clock in the evening before going to sleep. Dedicate the first 2-4 hours after you wake up to maximize your brain’s peak performance time. If for example you wake up at 7, your peak times are between 9 and 11 a.m.

## 4. Do a short 20–30 minute cardio workout.

Being physically active improves both your physical and mental well-being, plus you get the boost of endorphins (happy hormones) when you break a sweat. But instead of aiming too high (“I have to spend two hours at the gym!”), start with a super simple workout session, either in the morning before you start your daily commute or when you’re done with work or school. Pick a shorter activity that requires your body to move, such as a 15 minute bootcamp session, a set of lunges and squats, a power walk, bike ride, or quick run through the neighborhood.

## 5. Calm your busy thoughts with meditation.

If you find yourself often feeling overwhelmed and stressed, you can quiet your mind from all those busy thoughts with a simple 10-minute meditation practice. Download the Headspace app, which makes it super simple for beginners. Practice 10 minutes consistently for 10 days. Experiment to find out which time works better for you, mornings after you wake up or right before going to sleep. After that you can opt to increase the time to 15 and later 20 minutes, or you can keep it to 10 if that amount of time works for you.

## 6. Create your fiction book-reading ritual.

If you haven’t given reading fiction a try, here are some benefits for you to consider. Did you know that reading fiction improves brain function and boosts connectivity in the brain? It’s not my personal opinion — science backs it up. Neuroscientists from Emory University published a study called Short and Long Term Effects of a Novel on Connectivity in the Brain explaining the benefits in detail. To make reading a daily practice, get a library membership, download the Goodreads app to help you find topics and writers, and read up on Quora’s novel recommendations to get started on your reading journey.

## 7. Practice a growth mindset.

If you think that a mindset is something you’re just born with, think again. Unlike having a fixed mindset (where you believe you’re born with a set of skills and abilities that are in your “nature”), cultivating a growth mindset means you push yourself outside your comfort zone, challenge beliefs on what you can and cannot (or “should not”) do, and re-program your mind so you can develop your core qualities and skills through continuous efforts. I created an online course that’s great for beginners and that shows you how to implement a growth mindset way of thinking in your everyday life. Click here for more details if you’d like to enroll
