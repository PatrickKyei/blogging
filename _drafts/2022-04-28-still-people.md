Change is an important thing in the life of man. It is something we cannot do without. It ensures renewal and growth in our lives. By replacing everything old, unproductive, unhelpful, stagnant or weak with a new thing. It is what ensures that we continue to grow and progress.

What is required of us is to accept the change agent and embrace the process that is required for our transformation. Even though this is the truth, it does not happen easily. Change can be a difficult process to go through. This is because sometimes in order to give us something greater, it takes what we hold to be dear or precious away from us.

Because of this many people are not able to change. They are not able to change because they are not willing to change.

They are **still** the same all the time. And I call them **"Still People"**.

Walking with still people can have a negative impact on our lives. And that is because they would do anything to talk you out of any change that will help improve your life. They will rub their fear of change on you.

One of the best things you can do is to **stay away from them**.

These are some of the still behaviors that will help you identify these type of people:

## Still Complaining

> Complains won't change the outcome.

Challenges in life are inevitable. They are like staircase of life. If you want to go higher you must be willing to climb them. 

Some people are not willing to deal with these challenges but expect change in their life. When things are not going on well for them instead of identifying the problem and looking out for ways to fix it, they will complain.

Yesterday they complained, today they are complaining and tomorrow they will complain again. If you ask them about what they are doing to alleviate the problem, they are not going to be able to tell anything useful. Instead they will play blame games. 

Always blaming their problems on something or someone. And the funny part they will not look out for help but instead stay there and expect things to change. 

## Still Broke

> If you are not willing to work for it, then don't complaing about not having it.



## Still Hating

## Still Nowhere
