Normally I would do a few courses after I'd close from work to stay up to date before settling down and decide what to eat and then sleep.

Today was different. I shut my pc off, turn down the lid. I shuffled through the thoughts that flashed through my mind when I started my day.

Earlier today as I went about my morning routine, the thoughts of regrets rushed through my mind. I didn't give much of a thought to it because I still needed to finish up with a couple of things and get ready for work.

But from all indications that thought didn't really leave my mind completely because when I settled down at work I was still thinking about what causes regret in people's lives. I was thinking about some of my own regrets and their contributing factor. 

I gave this some few thoughts and decided to shift the whole conversation to the end of the day.

But you reject that offer, stay home and cry over unemployment?

You want this but act like you don't need it and then you lose and regret it.

So maybe you might even be overqualified for the job but you'd be rejected and that would be a surprise to you. Yet, apply to next one. 

You might be the one who is right and yet still your apology would still be
