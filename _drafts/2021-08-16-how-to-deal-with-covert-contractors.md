## What is a Covert Contract?

A covert contract can simply be put as when someone has an unfulfilled expectations around you but doesn't communicate their concerns.

This can be anyone as your friend, family member or a colleague at work. Often these people may go quiet and distance themselves at times.

Now here is a classic example of how this might happen.

Let's say you have a friend who helped you do your school or work projects, it may be house chores or any other tasks you may have that they helped you with. Your friend might have helped you with these tasks on many occasions at their own will. They later expect you to be able to help them or return this favor. Or to put it simply, they expect you to return their favor in the future and if you don't or are unable, they get mad at you.

Now in their head, they had a covert contract that said if I help this person with their project then they have to help me with these stuff later; but you never agreed on it. So you think you are still friends but they are mad at you because you couldn't fulfill your end of bargain that you never really made, that only exists in their head.

This happens in dating and this happens in all kinds of situations. "If I drive her to the airport then she becomes my girlfriend", or "If I help this person over and over then they owe me one." But nobody owes you anything.

### How Do You Identify A Covert Contract

Often you will be able to tell a covert contract if the person starts to be silent and distant. Also signs of passive aggressiveness is one.

People are sometimes moody and how do we know a covert contract from a behavior of emotions?

First of all if the person is able to pin point an incidence of favor that you have not returned, that is a covert contract. But if the person is just quiet and distant because he or she has some emotional stuff going on and he or she doesn't react to stress well, that's not really a covert contract.

If it's been part of a past behavior when the person voiced it out and you can see a similar pattern now, then you can say it is a covert contract.

If it is a covert contract then this person is expecting you to read their mind, and they will go passive aggressive if you don't. **But frankly that burden is not on you**; this is what covert contractors want you to feel. Like you've done something wrong by not reading their mind and filling a need they've got that is unstated. It's frankly controlling immature behavior.

### What To Do Next?

We all do this sometimes especially with our partners or close friends. But really I think we should realize it is not a good idea to do this. Because we should be able to say, "Hey I think it's crappy that you showed up an hour late when we told you when the time was gonna be, and it's inconvenient to everyone to show up late like that." And that's how mature people handle stuff like this.

And if the person is expecting you to just know because you should know, that's their issue and not yours. And you can ask directly what the deal is and if they say nothing, then good, you can take the word of their face value: don't push and don't probe. You have no reason to figure out whether or not they really mean nothing. You are not married and even if you are they shouldn't act like that.

And if there's a problem and they come clean and state what it is, you then have a right to ask why they didn't bring it up earlier. When they start to give excuses on you, tell them to bring it up earlier in the future. Ask them to tell you what is going on. And if they don't then you have to decide if you want to be friends with somebody who just actually enjoys been mad and causing drama. Because that's all that it is.

You are under no obligations to read people's minds or fix and repair covert contracts that other people place on you. You did not agree to the contract in the first place. You don't have to fix it or make it right. You may lose some friends who do this eventually, that's okay. People like this grow out of it or they don't. It is not your responsibility to make sure your friends mature beyond this. If you ask directly and they still don't tell you but they stay mad, that is their drama. And I suggest you opt out of that whenever it arises.
