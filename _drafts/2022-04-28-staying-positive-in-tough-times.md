Everything begins with how you perceive yourself. Consider yourself worthy. Feel unique. Feel as if you are deserving of the best in life. Those who appear to have it all are no different than you. You can also feel different if you believe you are deserving of the best.

Spend no more than 5 minutes worrying about something that will not matter in 5 years. No amount of adversity can destroy you. Worry about what’s gonna happen in the 5 years that matter.

The same chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) that cause happiness and joy—dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins—can be deliberately used to increase positivity. The good news is that the brain is unconcerned about whether you are happy or sad. It only responds to stimuli that cause it to be happy or sad, and it starts responding immediately by releasing the corresponding chemicals.

2020 is not the worst year of your life. It is the year when nature re-asserts itself as an authority over humans. In fact, it could be the best year yet, because it awakened humanity to the realities of life and challenged our mental faculties to the effect that nature is still the least understood phenomenon in our universe.

Tough times do not come to destroy you; rather, they come to bring out your best qualities. When things get tough, don't just focus on survival or ways to get out; otherwise, you'll miss the big picture. Open your mind and look for opportunities.

Even when all doors are locked, there is always a way out. Don't give up hope. Continue looking. Continue your search. Continue to knock. Somebody will arrive on the scene who is impacted by the constant noise of your knockings.

Tough times don't last, but tough people do. How will you know if you're tough unless you've been put through the ringer? Diamonds cannot be formed unless they are subjected to pressure and heat.

Maintaining a positive mental attitude can defeat the most cruel of situations. Negativity will definitely break the toughest man or woman. When it comes to mind over matter, mind always wins.

Hope cuts through despair like a candle light shinning through darkness or like laser cutting through metal, or like a hot knife cutting through butter. No amount of darkness, however intense, will ever put out the candle light. History is full of hopeful men and women who overcame great obstacles, and also full of desperate men and women who had no hope.

The purpose to exist is stronger than the toughest time. If you find yourself desperate and on the verge of giving up, the bet way to survive is to find a valid purpose to live. More importantly, find a good purpose to live for others.

The best way to stay positive during tough times is to stay active. Just do something. Be active. Do anything, but don’t be passive. Use your imagination. If you’re in a prison cell, imagine that you’re in a track field and jog around your cell. If you’re in a lockdown, exercise your body. Imagine you’re in a gym. Punch the air. Never allow yourself to be static. Maintain focus. Breathe in and out before and after each session of exercise.

Develop a morning ritual, day ritual and evening ritual. Don’t allow yourself to succumb to situations that make you stagnant. Always make sure you’re growing. Good and bad times are part of life, so never let them retard you.

Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill. What you fear will never happen. Most of what you fear is just imagination. What you focus on most, grows bigger in your mind. And what you focus on less, shrinks in size.

Finally, the best way to stay positive during tough times is to stay close to someone who is positive enough and close to you. Two people are better than one. Three are even better. And if you have no one, don’t die yet. Someone who has you in mind has already been sent to you.
