Every year teaches us two things: 

## 1. No one is permanent

Every year teaches us that no one is permanent. 

As we move through the cycles of life, we are constantly reminded that nothing stays the same.  
People come and go, relationships are formed and dissolved, and even the world around us is constantly in flux.

As we reflect on the past year, we may think about the people and things we have lost.  
We may remember loved ones who have passed away, or cherished relationships that have ended. We may recall the ways in which our own lives have changed and evolved.

But while these losses can be painful, they also remind us that life is precious and fleeting. They teach us to cherish the moments we have with the people we love, and to make the most of the time we have.

In addition, these changes also open up new opportunities and possibilities. As one chapter ends, another begins. It's important to remember that change is not always a bad thing and it brings new experiences and growth.

So, as we look ahead to the new year, let us embrace the changes and uncertainty that come with it. Let us remember that no one is permanent, and that every moment is an opportunity to make the most of our time. And let us cherish the people and things that matter most to us, knowing that they may not always be with us.

## 2. Life has to move on

Every year teaches us that life is constantly in motion and that we must adapt to the changes that come our way. 

Whether it's a new job, a new relationship, or the loss of someone we love, we are constantly reminded that life is not static and that we must learn to move forward.

One of the most important lessons that each year brings is that we must let go of the past and focus on the present. We can't change what has happened, but we can learn from it and use it to shape our future. Holding onto past regrets or resentments will only hold us back and prevent us from living in the present moment.

Another important lesson that each year teaches us is that we must learn to be resilient. Life is full of challenges and setbacks, but we must learn to bounce back and keep moving forward.  
We must learn to find strength in the face of adversity and to keep pushing through when things get tough.

Finally, each year reminds us that life is precious and that we must make the most of every moment. We must learn to appreciate the beauty in the small things, to cherish the time we have with loved ones, and to make the most of every opportunity that comes our way.

In conclusion, every year teaches us that life is always moving forward and that we must learn to adapt to the changes that come our way. We must let go of the past, be resilient in the face of adversity, and make the most of every moment. So, let's embrace the new year with open arms and look forward to all the lessons and experiences it will bring.
