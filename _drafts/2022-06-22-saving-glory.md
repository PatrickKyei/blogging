As an adult you are likely aware of the differences between your childhood and adult life.

You are considerably more worried now about things in your adult life than you were aware of in your childhood days.

The internal struggle; **low self esteem**, **imposter syndrome**, battles with **procrastination** and so on. These are compounded by the external factors we face daily; **rejection** from people, **negative criticism**, **discouragement** and the likes.

In the midst of all these is our desire to be successful at life. Sometimes it feels like life is holding you by the neck.

So today I want to cheer you on. If you are still holding on and you are trying your best, you are a CHAMPION

**CHAMPIONS** aren't people who don't fall, fail or get bruised. Champions are people who fall and get up, people who fail and still try again, people who bruise but learn to heal and march on.

Sometimes life is like that. We get bruised, we fail and we fall.

But as long as we have life, we will face this battle and who knows, we might WIN.

And this will be our saving glory.
