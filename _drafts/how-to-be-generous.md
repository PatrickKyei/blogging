> Stuff doesn't matter; in short expensive things are fun but they don't mean as much as the experiences you share with people you care about.

I appreciate a good leather jacket and a cool car, fancy bed frame, expensive grocerries, obviously those things have some value but they're just nothing compared to spending time with people you really love. 

I know it feels like cheesy talk and I know I talk about it all the time but every year it becomes clearer and clear to me that relationships, experiences, acts of service, those are things that really matter in life. They're kind of all that really matters in life.

I mean look you can be driving a Bugatti, cool. Where are you going in it? You can be sitting on some super fancy pup for long but who's sitting next to you? 

You know what I mean, create memorable experiences for yourself. It doesn't have to be some huge thing. Hit up a friend for some Sunday 'fufu' (a local Ghanaian diet) over the weekend, call your mom, call your dad, call your brother, your sister, your cousin whoever it is. 

Ask him how they're doing, tell them what they mean to you. Take your colleague to lunch tell, them what made you proud this year, write an email to your boss or your professor or your mentor, thank them for teaching you what they taught you. Book a weekend trip with your best friend, take your mom out to lunch, take your dog on the hike and invite two friends you haven't seen in a while.

I promise you will not regret this kind of thing because the people we keep in our lives, how we show up for them, how they show up for us, the way we share our love and our ideas and our attention, that is what makes life meaningful.

All the science about happiness proves it. We know this in our bones, it's just so easy to forget when we're caught up in the day to day of our lives. So my top piece of advice for you; Be generous with what you have at this moment. Whatever that is. It doesn't have to be money or gift or vacations - in fact the less tangible the better and give it to the people that you care about.

That is the big secret which isn't really a secret at all. Just give and find out how far giving yourself to other people will take you in life.
