> How to be generous.

It okay but I think what the story really captures though is stuff doesn't matter the stuff doesn't matter I'm in short expensive things are fun I appreciate a good leather jacket and a cool car whatever fancy bed frame from stores I can't pronounce obviously those things have some value but they're just they're nothing compared to spending time with people you really love and I know it's cheesy I know it's kind of tried I know I talk about it all the time but every year I do this show it just becomes clearer and clear to me relationships experiences acts of service those are things that really matter in life they're kind of all that really matters in life and away I mean look you can be driving a 

Bugatti cool where are you going in it you can be sitting on some super fancy chess long that I say correctly this time gabe long in the world but who's sitting next to you you know what I mean I'm not to be like too cheesy about it but my hope for this holiday actually my invitation for you because we usually need to be proactive and do this stuff ourselves is that you create those experiences for yourself doesn't have to be some huge thing it up a friend for a pumpkin spice latte over the holiday call your mom call your dad call your brother your sister your cousin whoever it is ask him how they're doing tell them what they mean to you take your colleague to lunch tell them what made you proud this year write an email to your boss or your professor or your mentor thank them for teaching you what they taught you book a weekend trip with your best friend take your mom out to lunch take your dog on the hike and invite two friends you haven't seen in a while I promise you will not regret this kind of thing because the people we keep in our lives how we show up for them how they show up for us the way we share our our love and our ideas and our attention that is what makes life meaningful all the science about happiness proves it we know this in our bones it's just so easy to forget when we're caught up in the day to day of our lives so my last peace of advice for this year be generous with what you have at this moment whatever that is it doesn't have to be money or gift or vacations in fact the less tangible the better and give it to the people that you care about that is the big secret which isn't really a secret at all just to give and to find out how far giving yourself to other people will take you in life and that's as good a place as any I think to put this show down for the year
