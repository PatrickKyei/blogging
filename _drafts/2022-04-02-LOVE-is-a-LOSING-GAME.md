> **4** Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. **5** It does not dishnor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. **6** Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. **7** It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.

Love come with a lot promises. You go in hearing many promises and giving a lot of promises of your own without knowing exactly what to expect in return. So yeah, from the onset you start giving something without knowing what to get in return. 

What are your beliefs, principles, values in love? You go in compromising and losing a lot of them. Maybe that's how it's desgned to be? i can't really tell.
