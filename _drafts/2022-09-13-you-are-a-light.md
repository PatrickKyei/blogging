Your light does not come from your successes.  
Your light is not ignited by perfection  
Or achievement or body shape.

Your light is not fuelled by popularity or acceptance  
Neither is your light at any risk of being put out  
When other lights around you, are bright.

Your light is simply made of the you-ness that makes you you  
The worries you have in the night  
The music which sparks your joy  
The books you had to read twice  
The memories stored safely in your heart  
The people you love and the people who love you.

Your light is never dependant on how you look  
Or how you perform.

It's just there  
And it's quite simply brilliant, and it's all yours.  
And it lights up every room you walk into  
Whether you activate it or not.

What a wonderful thing.

Shine bright little fighter  
This dark world needs your glow. _Donna Ashworth,from I Wish I Knew_
