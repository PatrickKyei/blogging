**It sounds like a vicious cycle, right?**

But being in your comfort zone just means you like what’s familiar. There are certain habits you repeat every day, there are specific rituals you believe work best as you’re completing your daily tasks, and there’s a way you talk to yourself (usually in the form of self-criticism) that has stuck with you for years. Underneath all those layers, there’s probably something that scares you. It’s scary to take risks because that sounds dangerous. It’s intimidating to meet new people because you think they won’t like you enough to be your friend. It’s risky to change the way you study or work because what if that yields negative results? It’s challenging to convince yourself to find a goal that’s unique to you and only you, instead of “adopting” a goal a friend told you about and now you want it too.

Breaking out of your comfort zone requires you to be honest with yourself. This means:

## 1. Acknowledging that you feel scared of something you don’t know.

We as humans all feel fear of some things, and that’s how we are wired. Fear has protected us and helped us survive. It has kept us on our toes, always on the lookout for danger and enemies and natural disasters, so that we can escape when we need to. And we often still feel that need to escape, even though we have come a long way from what our ancestors had to deal with every single day. But still, it’s best to be aware of the feeling.

👉🏾 _**Question to ask yourself:** What am I fearful about? Give the fear a name. Say it out loud._

## 2. Trying not to immediately have a negative reaction to something new.

Sometimes it’s that voice that you hear saying, I can’t do this! If it is, just chalk it up to your fixed mindset talking. What’s a fixed mindset? It’s your belief that your personality, skill set, and strengths are “fixed” i.e. you have them from birth, and that that’s just how it is. What’s better? Let your growth mindset do the talking. A growth mindset is when you start believing that you can cultivate strengths and skills through your efforts. When you get rid of negative self-talk, you give yourself the space to learn something new.

👉🏾 _**Questions to ask yourself:** Do I say something is difficult because I’ve always told myself similar things are difficult, and how would I change this if I could start all over again?_

## 3. Remembering why you’re doing something.

Whatever you’re working on, it’s important to mentally “step out” of the current situation and connect with the initial reason you started doing it. This will remind you that your actions are directly linked to a personal or professional goal. Maybe you started working on a new skill such as playing guitar to fulfill a lifelong dream. Or, you are studying for exams so that you can get a degree that will open doors to an exciting career and financial independence. Or maybe you’re looking for a job that is a better fit for your skill set and career path than the last one you had.

👉🏾 _**Questions to ask yourself:** Why is this challenge so important to me? What is at the core? What will I gain from solving it? What will this mean to my life in the long run?_

## 4. Anticipating obstacles.

When we are faced with an obstacle, we tend to stop what we’re doing and start reacting. It’s not fair! It’s impossible to fix this! But complaining won’t change a thing. What will make a difference is getting proactive. First, start anticipating that there will be obstacles you will encounter on your path. If you prepare yourself psychologically for them, they won’t feel so devastating when they actually do happen. Second, use the opportunity to learn something new, take a different approach to the problem, and try something different that can yield better results.

👉🏾 _**Questions to ask yourself:** What are 3 things I can do when I am faced with an obstacle? Which solutions can I brainstorm so that I have them ready in case I need them?_

## 5. Not overthinking and deciding to take action.

By now you’ve prepared yourself for what you need to do to get out of your comfort zone. There comes a time, however, when we should stop thinking and move on to the next step. It’s time to take action. Think of this situation as an experiment where you’ll try something new. You’ll see what happens next. You’ll learn something about yourself and your true abilities. You’ll adapt to the situation.

👉🏾 _**Questions to ask yourself:** What is the first step I can take to move forward? Do I need to study one topic to understand it better? Do I need to practice a skill in order to master it? Do I need to find a mentor who can provide guidance and offer advice?_
