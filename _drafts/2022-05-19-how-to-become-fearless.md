## Dive into your Fear

Pick something you are afraid of or find uncomfortable and try it out. Especially breaking social boundaries can be a huge courage boost.

Examples: Lie down in the middle of a food court for a minute. Scream “I love my life” out your window. Stand in town and talk about something you are passionate about; put a hat in front of you to make some extra money.

## Remember what Fears you beat thus far

There have been moments that you thought would be the end. Moments that made you so afraid of the future you could not see how you could move on afterwards. Yet, here you are. Remember that you beat those moments and somehow made it out. Trust in that same process to get you out this time.

## Sink your teeth into something truly valuable

You’ll be far less afraid of chatting up someone at a bar if you went to a third world country to build wells. It may seem unrelated, but the fact that you did something truly valuable in your eyes, gives you a very fluffy cushion to fall back upon should the situation turn for the worse.

## Ask yourself what a person of high value does in the world. What makes someone “valuable” in your mind? Then pursue exactly that yourself

## “I have no reason to be afraid”

Simply choose to be courageous, brave and bold, for no reason whatsoever. Not because you need to, not because you have proof of it, but simply because you feel like it! Because, while you have no reason to feel brave, the reason you feel fear are also largely based on nothing.

## Say “Yes” to more things

When something sounds even vaguely interesting, try it out! Go to that dance class you always were curious about, test yourself in a new, unusual sport and get some music lessons to play the instrument you wanted to play. Join friends in their hobbies, try some of the crazy things you read online and live a little more boldly overall. Say “Yes” to your own life more!
Say “No” to more things - Do you actually want to do this?

## Does this actually sound interesting?

Or are you just doing it to be perceived well by others? Make a clear cut on the things that you do more for others than yourself. Say “No” to the agendas of others and instead make up your own mind.

## Have Fun

I remember sitting in a horror ride at an amusement park with a friend who laughed at every scary thing that popped up. In the face of that much joy I could not take the scary things seriously and began to laugh as well. When we take things seriously and when we become unable to laugh at them is when they turn scary and threatening. Before then, they are just things.

## Accept the Fear

Let the fear come. Let it overtake you. Let it make your heart pound in your chest and let it make sweat rush down your face. And then, do the crazy thing and do it anyway! You do not have to resist the fear or become devoid of fear to be brave. So you might as well accept it because trying to hide from it or run from it just validates its existence.

> “Courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who conquers that fear.” - Nelson Mandela
