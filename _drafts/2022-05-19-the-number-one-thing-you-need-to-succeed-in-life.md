Many will tell you that you have to work hard.

Others will tell you that working hard is important, but working smart is even more important.

Some will tell you that you need to surround yourself with the right people to succeed.

Others will tell you that you need to constantly increase your knowledge throughout your life.

I'll stop there, but you get the idea. You've grasped it all the better because you have people constantly giving you this kind of advice.

It's good advice, but even if you apply it to the letter, you won't be able to succeed without this essential thing I'm going to talk about.

This essential quality made Thomas Edison one of the greatest inventors in history. His inventions revolutionized humanity and are still changing our daily lives today.

This quality is perseverance!

It is the key to success. The difference between someone who will succeed in life and someone who will not could be summed up in this image :

The loser will fail 99 times and then give up.

The winner will fail 99 times, then try again, and that's when he will succeed.

To succeed, you must be patient and never give up. You must always learn from your failures, adapt, and move on.

Are your goals important enough for you to be able to pursue them for 5 years, 10 years, 20 years?

This is the only question you need to ask yourself. If the answer is no, you are probably not targeting the right goals. By not targeting the goals that will make you want to surpass yourself for as long as you need to, you are leaving with a handicap.

So the first thing you need to do is to set goals that really motivate you.

Once this is done, you will be able to keep trying year after year despite the countless failures that will mark your journey. If you do it with the same intensity each time, you will eventually become successful. Sooner or later.
