I'm thinking very much about this.  I think one of the challenges I find in Africa and every concerned   African is worried about is keeping to time. You see as humans beings alive all we have is time. In other words your life is just the time you have on earth. If you say someone is 70 years it means he had 70 years of time, which is 2,207,520,000 of seconds spent. So I find that to respect any human being you respect their time. If you disrespect their time you disrespect the whole human being and this means you don't mind wasting  that moment of their life that has been entrusted to you. It is that serious! Now the biggest crime in the law books is murder. Murder is shutting somebody's life; the time they have on this earth. So if you waste somebody's one hour you've committed partial murder. This is how serious it is.

So in dealing with your respective people and this if you get it right is ultimate customer service. When somebody walks to you and is looking for a service, use as little as their time as possible and give their life or their time back to them for them to decide what they want to do with it. Now the time that you take to serve them the additional bet is  that make sure it's quality time and they find it memorable. Because there are two aspect to time, the shared quantity of it and  the quality of it. 

Quantity, you don't determine it, quality you can do something about it. So customer service and to win clients and all that make sure that you deal with them that shortest possible time. If you have to extend it ask their permission and show concern and don't waste their time because you are wasting their life. And make sure that the time you spend with them is quality time. And anytime they remember you by the quality time you shared with them and they wish to spend to moments with you again. And that is what life is all about.  

In Africa we got it all wrong. The moment you are successful, you are  successful or you are big man it means you can just disrespect anybody's time.

 I think really really If we will address our woes in Africa with respect to time, the other things will fall in to place and it is not a joke. And if you want to think about innovation, don't think anything, think time.

Is the new product or service going to save time or is it going to give quality time? It must qualify under one of these things. It's either saving time or providing quality time, nothing else matters.
