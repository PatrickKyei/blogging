Nothing can stand the test of time. Eventually, everything must finally, and sadly, come to an abrupt end.

Do you want to know the latest drug? It’s called social media.

Everyone must finally discover the ultimate horror of having sex.

Never pin your hopes on empty promises. Empty promises are things that did not exist in the first place.

What really matters is not believing in yourself. It is trusting yourself.

Most people feed themselves from their necks down, but what really contributes to our growth is feeding ourselves from the neck up.

Have you ever considered why we’ve been watching TV for decades and not yet experienced any change? Because TV was not designed to bring change. It was designed to make us illiterate.

Most people think that change is something that jumps out of the pages of a textbook into the mind. Change is actually something that the mind conceives from within.

You are one of 3 things — you will never change, or you will watch others change, or you will become the change.

Death was never the greatest tragedy. The greatest tragedy is to live in this life and never show up.

The majority of people fall in love through the eyes the first time. That means you should be very careful who you let your eyes come into contact with.

The best way to judge a woman's loyalty is when her man has nothing. The best way to judge a man's loyalty is when he has everything.

Fortunes do not necessarily change men as much as it unmasks them.

Bullying is for people who have no confidence in themselves. The reason they do it is to try and shake off their own demons.
To fall in love is awfully simple, but to fall out of love is simply awful.

Retirement is when the living is easy and the payments are hard.

Best friends are like diamonds; precious and rare. Bad friends are like tree leaves; they’re found everywhere.

A stranger stabs you in the front; A friend stabs you in the back; A boyfriend stabs you in the heart, but best friends only poke each other with straws.

The daily grind of hard work gets a person polished but also emaciated and painfully tired.

Kissing is the merging of two lips, two souls and two spirits that makes them one.

Siblings are the only enemy you can't live without.
Denial is the way we know best how to handle that which we don’t comprehend.

Sometimes those who don't socialize much aren't actually anti-social; they just have no tolerance for drama and fake people.

Love is like a tornado; it sweeps you off your feet and sometimes takes half your house.

Sometimes we tend to be in despair when the person we love leaves us, but the truth is, it's not our loss, but theirs, for they left the only person who wouldn't give up on them.

You will never know true happiness until you have truly loved, and you will never understand what pain really is until you have lost it.

Sometimes you have to stand alone to prove that you can still stand.

Why do people say “no offense" just before they’re about to offend you?

The secret of discovery is not in looking for new lands, but in looking at existing land with new eyes.

Being happy doesn’t mean that everything is perfect. It means that you’ve decided to look beyond the imperfections.

1. Nothing can stand the test of time. Eventually, everything must finally, and sadly, come to an abrupt end.

2. To fall in love is awfully simple, but to fall out of love is simply awful.

3. Never stop learning because life never stops teaching.

4. You will regret the things you didn't do much more than ones you did

5. Your biggest regret will be that you didn’t do what you love (unless it’s not)

“I wish I’d had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.”

6. Nobody cares how difficult your life is, and you are the author of your life’s story. Stop looking for people to give you sympathy and start creating the life story you want to read.

7. You care more about what other people think than about what you think--and it's destroying your confidence.

8. You blame other people for your problems so that you can feel better about your own shortcomings.

9. A book only gives you a piece of information but life experience gives you long-lasting lessons.

10. Truth is simple, but the moment you try to explain it, it becomes difficult.

11. Someone else will always have more.

12. You cannot make everyone happy. Learn to accept that you cannot make everyone like you, just be yourself, and let the one come into your life who is ready to accept you just the way you are.

13. Sometimes there’s no right choice, sometimes the outcome will be bad no matter what you choose to do, but you still have to choose.
