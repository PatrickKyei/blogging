What sums it up for me is the famous Lennon quote **"Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans."**

Back when I was single sharing an apartment with two friends had zero money, just living paycheck to paycheck was some really happy times.

We would train and go dancing and clubbing and had a ball. Then I fell in love with this girl in 2000: (my housemate)


Then I got married in 2003 and still had no “wealth” but we were happy. We both worked and paid for our own wedding and 5 week honeymoon across Canada.

Then we worked and saved and bought a house in the suburbs,

The mortgage was a big commitment. We did everything we could to pay all our extra money into it.

We had some more great times, 7 years and wonderful memories in this house including the birth of our daughter which turned us from a couple into a family. But we watched our budget, always paid our credit cards off monthly, lots of two for one coffees, and took all the discount deals we could to save money.

I got promoted and changed jobs climbing the corporate ladder, my salary increased, and we invested in shares. Blue chip conservative shares but they grew and paid dividends that we reinvested.

We sold our house for a sizeable profit and moved to Singapore for my job, a big career move. More money.

Another 8 years in Singapore living life. Birthday parties, holidays but also watching our budget. We live below our income and invest in more shares. We don’t have a car, we don’t eat out much we don’t travel business class even though we can afford it.

There are several paradoxes of finally becoming wealthy.

The first is that you can spend your whole life trying to become wealthy so you can enjoy material things, then when you can easily afford them you realise the relationships and good times you spend with people you love are so much more valuable.

My daily equity statement I receive via email is barely worth a glance but my wife and daughter and our good times together, that’s what life is really all about.

I live for my wife and daughter’s smiles and laughter. Wealth gives comfort and peace of mind, but the smiles of your loved ones are so much more valuable.
