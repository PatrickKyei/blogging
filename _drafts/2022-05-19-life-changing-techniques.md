Getting your life together basically consists of 4 “pillars”.

Health
Wealth
Relationships
Personal Development
Sure, you could throw adventure, contribution, environment, and a whole bunch of other factors into the mix.

But if you have vibrant health, abundant wealth, close relationships, and consistent personal development, I’ve found that everything else takes care of itself.

Now, I’m about to give you the actionable steps that I used to go from broke, in debt, living on my brother’s couch, and totally depressed to living on the beach, in the best shape of my life, running a 7 figures business, and dating the woman of my dreams.

But before I do, I need to make something clear.

My personal transformation took almost 2 years. In my experience coaching hundreds of men, I’ve found this number to be pretty consistent.

If you want to truly change your life, then you need to be patient.

Real change takes time. Getting yourself “together” doesn’t happen overnight.

In the same way that you don’t wake up one day and “magically” screw up your entire life, you can’t wake up one day and magically fix it.

You have to stick to the processes for months and years before you will reap the benefits.

So just accept this fact and get ready for the journey.

Now…

Let’s dive into the nitty-gritty.

I. Health

1. Sleep 8 Hours

If you aren’t sleeping 8 hours a night, you’re doing it wrong. You need plenty of high quality sleep to function at the highest levels. Period.

Invest in a good mattress and some black out shades. Turn the tv off 60 minutes before bed. Take some ZMA and valerian root. Meditate. Do whatever you need to do to get the best night of sleep possible and everything else becomes easier.

2. Eat Clean Burning Foods

Here’s a fun fact you probably don’t know. Did you know that obese individuals, because of the types of foods that they (not the amount) literally become less intelligent?

Processed foods, exorbitant amounts of sugar, and other bad foods cause inflammation in the brain which leads to impaired cognition among tons of other health problems.

I don’t know about you, but I would have a hard time getting my life together if the foods I ate literally made me dumber.

Stick to whole foods 80% of the time, veggies, fruits, meats, nuts, etc. And you’ll feel, think, and live better.

3. Lift Weights at Least 3 Times a Week

No excuses. You need to lift weights, harden your body, and develop your strength regularly to be your best self.

The discipline and mental toughness you develop in the gym will apply to other areas of your life and help you become the best version of yourself.

4. Walk for 30 Minutes a Day

Walking is absolutely one of the best forms of exercise you can do. Just 30 minutes a day works wonders for your energy levels and longevity, pair this with point #5, and I promise the entire flow of your days will change.

5. Get Outside and Soak Up the Sun

The skin cancer scare has convinced people that the sun is bad. It’s not. Burning is bad. The sun itself provides the human body with so many benefits that 15 minutes of daily exposure has been linked to a significant decrease in mortality from all causes.

I’d personally aim for 30–45 minutes of early morning sun exposure every day. Trust me, it’ll change how you feel and live.

II. Wealth

1. Master a Highly Marketable Skill

THE fastest way to make money is to develop a marketable skill like copywriting, funnel development, web development, email marketing, social media advertising, or sales and then sell your service at a premium price.

I know guys who are so good at writing sales copy that converts that they make more than $50,000 PER sales letter (~2,000 words and maybe 3 days of work).

If you want to get your financial life together start by developing a marketable skill. Invest in books, courses, and coaches until you’re in the top 5% of the world at what you do.

Once you get to that level, you’ll never have to worry about money again.

2. Surround Yourself with Wealthy People

Environmental exposure is one of the fastest ways to accelerate your financial reality.

By spending time with wealthy people you will start to adopt their habits, mindsets, and routines. You’ll learn about how business really happens and become richer for it. Join meetups, find a mentor, do whatever you need to do to get aroud successful people.

It will change your life.

3. Live Below Your Means, Embrace Minimalism, and Eradicate Debt

If you follow steps 1 &2, you will start to make a lot more money than you’re currently earning. When you do, DON’T increase your quality of life.

Live like you’re still broke. Become a minimalist. Get out of debt. And then move onto step #4 before you start expanding your expenses.

I’ve been earning multiple 6 figures for almost 4 years now. My business broke 7 figures last year.

Yet I’ve lived in the same 400 square foot apartment for almost 5 years. I only recently signed a lease on a larger place and, at this point, I’ve built such a strong financial infrastructure that I won’t even notice when my rent is paid.

Compare this to some of my even wealthier friends who live in 8000 square foot mansions and drive Ferrari’s but are only one bad business decisions away from going broke.

It’s not about how much you earn, it’s about how much you keep.

Speaking of which…

4. Build Your War Chest

You need to save money for the purpose of investing to generate passive income. I’d recommend keeping your quality of life the same until you have about $50,000 in your war chest and can start investing in cash producing assets.

This simple tactic allowed me to make $13,000 in 3 days during the cryptocurrency boom, launch a 6-figure sales funnel in only 2 months, and invest in plenty of other endeavors that have paid out handsomely.

Don’t save for a rainy day. Save so that you can swoop in when opportunity presents itself.

5. Educate, Educate, Educate

You weren’t taught how to manage your money properly in school. So you need to educate yourself now. Read as many books as you can. Check out blogs like I Will Teach You to Be Rich, Mr. Money Mustach, and Money Under 30.

III. Relationships

1 Accept that Relationships Are a Skill

While most people accept that they can improve their health and finances, many people assume that they’re either good at relationships or bad at them.

That’s a load of crap.

Relationships are a skill like anything else. You can learn how to interact with your preferred sex more effectively. You can learn to communicate better. You can learn to be a better partner.

Accept this and your life will change.

2. Focus on Your Personal Development and Growth First

Before you worry about a relationship, you must start by focusing on yourself. Develop yourself into the kind of person your future partner would want to be with.

Get your life together and become a stronger person. It will make relationships easier.

3. Learn to Be Ok Being Wrong

You don’t need to be right all the time.

Sure, when it comes to big decisions you and your partner should talk things over. But when it comes to small things, it’s ok to compromise and let your partner “win”.

Relationships aren’t a competition and you don’t always need to be right.

4. Never Settle

Ever.

If you aren’t saying “Hell yes!” about your partner, then they’re a “Hell no”

5. Understand How You Interact with Others

Learn about your personality type, attachment style, love language, communication style, and anything else that will help you improve how you interact with other people.

Self knowledge is the key to relationship success.

IV. Personal Development

1 Journal Every Day

Get out of your head and get your thoughts on paper. This single practice has probably saved my life. It gives you the clarity and emotional space you need to think and process. Do it every day even if it’s just for 2 minutes.

2. Meditate for 15 Minutes a Day

You have no excuse not to meditate. The benefits are endless and it will change your life in ways you can’t even imagine.

Practice it for 15 minutes a day for the next 30 days and I promise your life will change.

3. Plug Positivity into Your Brain Daily

Listen to podcasts, audiobooks, and motivational YouTube videos. Put more positivity into your mind and you’ll get more of it out of your life.

4. Do Something that Scares You Sh*tless

Confidence and strength are built by embracing fear and stepping into the unknown.

Do something that scares the crap out of you. Travel solo, start a new business, get out of the relationship that isn’t serving you. Do something that scares you silly and you’ll be better for it.

5. Love Yourself

You are the most important person in your life. Treat yourself as such.

Prioritize time alone, treat yourself, be kind to yourself, love yourself.

All great things come from a place of self-love.
