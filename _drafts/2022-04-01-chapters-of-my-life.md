Life is like a book written in chapters.

Every chapter has it's story to tell.
And for the past chapters that I have lived, 

In the 19th chapter of my life
I have identified these important basics of life

I share with you my whole experience ...
That   
Dreams are more powerful than facts
Life can only be understood backwards, But must be lived forwards
We can only know, when we try

It's real
Every door has it's key
But prayer is the answer that unlocks any door
Life's challenges are only to make us stronger
We can climb to the top of every mountain
Our freedom is our strength

Right! 
Perseverance is the code that unlocks success
Every road leads to somewhere and that 
There's an end to every road
The world holds nothing as 'permanent'
Nothing comes as cheap
Our hearts see farther than the eyes
And there's no place warm like the heart
Only you can love and understand yourself better
But no one is a living island
Everybody needs somebody
And that everbody comes first
It is really true that
What goes around comes around
The things that we did yesterday 
We do today
And we'll do tomorrow

Think true 
Today was once yesterday's tomorrow
No day will be far better than today
Find out
Every sweet material has it's sour side
Beautiful people have have big hearts
Sometimes you have to get dirty in order to be gentle 
Did you know
We were tested with a lot of test
But we were never tested with the final test
Which is survial

Understand that
Nothing comes easy or simple
Quiting on what you want doesn't make it yours
Life is lived once
So live it while you can
Every beginning has an end
There is joy after sorrow
Because every trouble has solution

Creativity is the best certificate
To every man there is a gift
Sometimes a man can't help
But to be a man
Success is guaranteed in not quitting
And quitting is not winning
