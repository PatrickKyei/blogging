## 1. Never suppress.

Suppressing your emotions is the reason you're experiencing this in the first place. Be brave enough to let your emotions out.

## 2. Ask for help.

Emotional strength comes from vulnerability. Whether it’s a professional or friend, talk to someone.

## 3. Know yourself.

Know what makes relaxes you. As long as you are alive problems won’t stop. Having an action plan to calm yourself will help.
Positive proof: Your mind tends to look for “how things won’t work out”. Flip that and start looking for proof on how things are working for you. Every little step is a win.

## 4. Meditate.

Learn to observe your thoughts and feelings as they arise. It took me a year of meditation to harness this, but it was worth it.

## 5. Self-care.

Make yourself feel loved and cared for. Take care of your body, take a day off, get a massage, etc.

## 6. Be patient. 

Nobody is perfect. This isn’t going to get fixed overnight. You shall gradually build up control as you start to fix the real issues.
