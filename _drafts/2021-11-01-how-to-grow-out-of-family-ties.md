## The Old Way

If you've lived in a typical African home, a Ghanaian family home to be more specific, you've probably seen how ties between parents and children can grow to be so deep. This is a great thing but sometimes the same good thing is able to truncate ones growth.

It's a common notion we have that a child will continue to remain a child to their parents, especially for their mom. And this is somethig common in Ghanaian culture. There are still African homes where parents still treat their children in their 20's and 30's as if they were tenaagers. This is something contrary to how a western family or home treats this relationship between parents and children. There would have actually been nothing wrong with this, but this is affecting how children ( the youth) are able to think for themselves and how they take initiatives to explore new opportunities that can better their lives.

## The Downside Of Attachment

They grow up very attached to their parents and they wait on their parents to point them in every direction in life, and then they grow to be more dependent on their parents. One of the responsibilities of parentood is to guide children to be independent and to be able to make decisions about their own lives but not necessarily to be the decision makers for their children. A western child can easily take initiative to explore areas of growth in their own lives and that is why most of them have become inventors and global innovators. 

## Growth And The Need For Change

As we grow up in the world, we begin to have our own dreams, aspirations and goals might be quite different from the ones that our parents had in the past or even envision for us. This is a great thing and so parents and children have to understand that at a point in life they are not going to be able to live very close to their parents anymore. Especially if you are thinking of having your own family, pursuing your own dreams and aspirations. And so this might require your breaking away from your parents and from the family ties that you have grown up with.

It can become very difficult sometimes because of the fear of making some life mistakes, the idea that it is going to be a huge responsibility for you to make the right decisions and take care of your own life. And so it is important to understand that you to be able to do this you should be able to accept and take take the risk.

## Hard Choice

So I know that doesn't make this choice any easier but I do think it's worth just taking a moment to appreciate how it's important to be able to take this next step in your life. So bottom line, you're going to have to make a choice. Either way that choice is going to have an opportunity cost. I know that sucks but that's the rules of life. If you move away from your parents you have to sacrifice that old ties that has been created and if you stay you'll have to give up your dreams and aspirations. I sounds to me like both of these opportunities are very important to you but at the end of the day, for you right now at this stage of your life, giving your goals and breaking away from that family ties which one do you consider more important? Which one is creating the life that you want to live in the next 5 10 20 years? Which one deserves your priority right now? 
And I wish I could answer that for you but only you can answer that. But I will share a couple of things that might help. 

First of all moving away from your family doesn't mean cutting them off from your life. If you guys really have that strong bond, it's not the end of that strong relationship you have built with your parents. It does suck and it will be frustrating sometimes but it doesn't have to be a relationship killer. 
It's very possible to travel or move away so that can you explore lives and search for better opportunites for own self or do whatever you want to do and so maybe you guys will keep in the touch using different methods of keeping a long distant relationship in this modern age.

You get your career on track, your parents figure out how to live their individual lives, you guys take turns visiting each other once a month. And that's just what you'd have to do until you figure out how to get very close to your parents once again. In a weird way you might find this time apart kind of refresing in its own way because you have to make the extra effort to call and and visite and write emails and stay connected and just missing each other even that's exciting. Then when you do see each other in person it's more meaningful, it's a lot more fun. 

So being apart might not be this terrible thing you think it's going to be if you guys find a way to stay connected which I bet you will and if there's light at the end of the tunnel it's not like you're going to be in a long distance for forever. You know that been away for a specific year with a due date is a lot easier. The other thing I'll say is that there's a good practical reason to prioritize your life and your career right now. In my opinion one needs a path in life and if you continue stagnating out in the prairies, that could set you back for a while and that could make it hard to provide when you do settle down especially if want to have your own family or your parents are old and they might have to depend on you later in life. So you're not just chasing your career and life goals for yourself, you're chasing it for all of you. 

So you have to factor that in as well so I know I said I can't tell you what to do but I am sort of leaning towards you taking the path of your career or goals and exploring new areas of opportunity for the next few years. So to keep you going whatever you decide, the only way to deal with the opportunity cost is you get super clear on what's important to you and accept that life comes with trade-offs or you find a way to lower that opportunity cost or create new opportunities out of them. So for example if I take the path towards my career, I will create new to keep in touch with my family and interact with them.  This time apart can be used to deepen your relationship in other ways. Plan weekend trips once a month so you get to have new experiences together. And at the same time you could use the uninterrupted time you have out away to really invest in yourself and your career so that when you guys get to be close together you'll have a great professional foundation in place and maybe that'll free up even more time to spend with your parents down the road.

That's how you can turn a crappy situation into a productive one if you roll with it a bit. And put in the work to make it the most of it.
So congrats ma guy to taking this next bold step in your life and towards your career. I know that's a tough call but remember that one day soon this chapter it's going to be a footnote in your amazing relationship with your parents so good luck by the way.
