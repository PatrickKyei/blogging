You can ask a really important question that some people never ask themselves okay all that said here are a few ideas that I would focus on first off invest in great relationships I'm not talking about finding a partner or a wife I know your family is on you for that I'm talking about developing meaningful connections with friends colleagues mentors bosses peers anyone really that you like and admire All of the research shows that the quality of our relationships determines most of the happiness in our lives And in terms of healing from depression specifically close intimate relationships and by that I mean relationships where you can really be yourself We are not playing a role or hiding aspects of who you are That's really the key to feeling connected to feeling fulfilled And I know that depression is complex I'm not glossing over that but having strong friendships to fall back on That's a great way to ease those feelings of alienation and shame and to not slip back into them when things get tough So if I were you I'd be actively working on meeting new people and taking a chance on sharing yourself with them And I'd also consider deepening the relationships you already have with your parents' siblings old friends whoever it is because investing in those relationships will also be a big part of really living in your thirties I wouldn't fix eight on getting married or finding a BFF or anything like that just focus on the people in front of you and see where those relationships take you at same time start exploring something that you care about I'm not just talking about you know like go get a job or through yourself into your career If this aligns with your career great but that can come later I'm talking about finding something that really lights you up It could be an issue and activity a puzzle a problem a sport a goal a craft a game anything really Make freaking artitional candles in the evenings I've got a friend who got heavy into that and you think I'm kidding but she had heavy into that during the patent it's almost become like meditation practice for her contributing to the Wikipedia page for pure breed dogs and ancient Rome I mean I made that up just now obviously but that's got to be a thing right why not Great phone banking for a candidate you believe in another great one So just put literally play around explore find that thing and then take tiny steps towards it every day forget the bigger picture forget making money just follow your curiosity for now If you do this consistently it will slowly nudge you towards your recording quote purpose you know I know that words over used but this is really what it means here but honestly doing something you really care about it doesn't even need to become something that profound it can just be fun it can just be interesting my friend who makes candles for example canal making definitely is not her purpose okay she's actually a cinematographer but these weird candles they've helped her deal with her anxiety her boredom they've made her more focused in her job she even mails the candles she makes to different friends around the country and she swears that it's made them closer so I'm actually a big fan of thinking small year small is good also in fasting in yourself read a ton share what you learn with the people you know maybe even with a few people you don't know yet apply what you learn to new situations new problems become a real nerd about one or two things that you care about also this one's obvious but it's crucial take care of yourself eat well exercise regularly this will work wonders for anxiety and depression I know you've heard it before it'll also make the rest of your life so much better honestly I'd make this a top five priority no matter what it is a game changer and finally if you aren't doing this already I would go to therapy it sounds like you've got a lot to talk about as we all do this is key not it just for working through the anxiety and depression that you face but for getting into more existential questions like what should my life be about and what is it all mean and what do I do with all these feelings I have about my past and my purpose and all that having a great therapist who can go there with you that is huge seriously don't think twice find someone good somebody who gets you and challenges you and start talking. And finally I would try to go on some adventures this is a little harder during the panDD but a lot of what I did when I was younger as travel around and get a ton of new experiences we've talked about things that light you up travel let me up of course but it also exposed me to new ways of thinking living eating the world to speaking that helped me grow really quickly I grew up quickly and I got a ton of life experience in a much shorter time than my peers and it helped me be kind of ahead of the game and a lot of ways this might help you make up for some loss time as well without actually taking a decade to do it. 
So go get it buddy, I know you might be a little late to the party but that does not matter. You are at the party and you are still so young. You have plenty of time to live your life, so good luck.
