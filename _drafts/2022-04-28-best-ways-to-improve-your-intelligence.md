## Connect the Dots

Start by learning how to connect the dots; look for similarities in everything you do.

Memorize more and do point 1

## Calm Your Mind

Let yourself fall into a state of mind of calmness. It’s the state of mind that allows you to stay sharp and use your full potential.

## Have A Goal In Mind

Have a greater goal in mind. What is it that you’re wanting to achieve? Keep it as a motivator after having done 3.

## Invest In Reading

Read more if you find the time to. Even then focus on what the author is trying to convey instead of the whole story. You’ll get faster at understanding.

## Don't Take Things Literally

Don’t take things literally. Meaning, try to see things from different perspectives. Taking things literally, not seeing them for what they are, will make you less intelligent.

Knowledge and insight are there to be discussed so don’t be afraid to think and see things differently.

## Surround Yourself With Likeminded People

Surround yourself with people who view intelligence as fluid. Intelligence isn’t everything, and knowing that, in return, keeps you intelligent.

## Express Gratitude

Express gratitude in some shape or form. Truly feel it. What keeps you alive also keeps you intelligent.

## Stay Humble

Stay humble. No matter how intelligent you are, if you’re not humble, you will one day come to regret that. So, stay humble, and enjoy learning.
