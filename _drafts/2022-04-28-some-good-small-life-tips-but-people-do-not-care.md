Live For Your Own Success - Do not chase others idea of success. It’s not what will make you happy in the end.
Take Responsibility For Your Life - If you want something you have to do the work to get it; no one else will do it for you.

The Best Time To Change Is Now - If you do it now you still get to live the rest of your life doing what you want. If you don’t you will get to live the rest of your life doing what you regret.

It’s Too Late Not To Try - You’ve been unhappy too long and your time is limited. Get a move on before you miss your chance to live the life you want to live.

Be Brutally Honest With Yourself - If you don’t like what you are doing call yourself out on it. Care more about your life than about how you feel about it.

Let Your Actions Speak Louder Than Your Words - Live by example. Show people what’s important to you and how you want to live.

Stay True To Yourself. Always. - Stand up for what you believe in, put your time into what means the most to you, and never say what you do not fully mean or intend to do.

Take Your Time When It Comes To Passion - Be it passion in a relationship or in your workplace, allow it to build up. Take your time with both.

Stop Being Busy - If you do not have time and do not get results you are wasting your time on tasks that do not matter.

Most Things Won’t Kill You - Your life will continue and it will move on. Most things are not as serious as you make them out to be.

Some People Are Not Worth It - Do not waste your time on people that only bring you down.

Failure Is The Process - To succeed in anything you must fail. That’s not a byproduct, it is the actual process to success.

The Goal Will Never Make Up For The Journey - If you hate the way there you will hate the result. Remember that the Journey is the goal, and therefore, the goal is the journey.

Remember To Have Fun - Isn’t joy what life is all about? Remember, in the busyness of the day, that you do not forget to smile every once in a while.
Be Brave - It’s the best way to lead a life by your design.

Life Isn’t Fair - But it is the only one you got. Deal with it and move on.

Never Be Ashamed Of What You Like - You cannot control what you like and do not like. Never be ashamed of being you.

The Only Way To Truly Fail Is To Give Up - It’s always the last person that stands that is victorious. If you can still stand up you haven’t lost yet.

Give Everything Your All - There is too much to life to give only half of what you could. Be bold, give it your all, fail big, and succeed even grander!

What Now? - No matter what happened in your past, you’re here now. That is a fact. What will you do?
