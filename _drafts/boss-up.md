> How successful are you if just one person is truly winning?

![put image here](https://imagelinkgoeshere.com)

Are you really the biggest boss? No, it should affect everyone that's coming to the table and bringing something to the table. It's simple. If you're the only one winning, hey man, you may not really be winning, man.

We're going to keep getting bigger. I'm going to keep sharing the experiences and the wisdom in the books, and that's just what I did. And I'm excited to see the response from my new book. 

Put yourself out there and believe in yourself. Treat everybody fair and put people on so that they can develop their own infrastructure and network." Like it's real advice. 

We most definitely just say the experiences, whether they were the best or maybe not the best, either way, life can be a beautiful struggle, man. Let's just enjoy this sh*t. Make the most out of it. And I'm getting straight to the point. I want to win and win big. Not only just win, but win big. 


Without a doubt
You have the same ambition that you had when you were younger. Obviously you have adult ambition now. You're not just like selling drugs out of the back porch or whatever. It's a completely different and more ambitious game. 

This is a value. I have a vision. Sometimes I roll the dice and I hit some lucky numbers.

"Look, nobody cares about your excuses. I don't have to worry about circumstances, but I go for it no matter what," and you bring up an important point. You said, "The moment you're waiting on doesn't exist. Everyone has problems. Some people use them as excuses. Other people use them as opportunities. It's your reaction to those problems that matters." How did you learn that? 

Embracing the process. You say you don't want it to be easy, right? The process is what makes you able to enjoy and manage success. The example I thought of is like, without the process, you're like that lottery winner who's like, "Oh, I have $10 million now." And then in two, three, five years, they're broke. 

Man, if I could only be confident to know, "Hey man, one day, you're going to be great, man."

I had to figure out certain things about myself, whether it was, if we're going to wash cars today, if we go hustle today, if we're cutting grass today. Or if we're going to help Mr. Thomas down the street, putting tar on his roof, and the tar down there near 200 degrees. And if it hit your foot, it would take your whole leg off. But guess what? If he gave us $20, a lot of times, we'd jump up on the roof and we learned certain things. So my drive is on a whole nother level and I appreciate it, and I still wake up 15 years later, look forward to doing interviews. I'm actually excited. I actually want to wear one of my nice sweaters. 

I'm still excited. We're still driving. We still got history to make. And to me, if it was about a dollar figure, we would have quit a long time ago but I think it's more about let's make history.

You say that success is based on what you do when no one is looking and you build one brick at a time. That is probably one of the most important. And one of the most overlooked bits of advice that I think a lot of people who are trying to make it think of. Like, they're really doing everything in front of the camera and when the camera's off, there's a lot of like, "Well, I'm done now because I posted it," or, "I'm done now because the video is out. I'm done now." 

You will most definitely be because everything that matters you have to take advantage of your time. Time is the most valuable asset you will ever have control of. So you have to take advantage of it right now.

How do you decide which habits or activities or people that you need to cut out? Because not everything is going to be aimed towards your goals. Like sometimes you just have friends, but I assume you've got a rule of thumb for this kind of thing.

Because three years from now, there's only certain things that's going to matter. The fluff as you call it. I'm a strong user of the fluff, that bullsh*t. We won't even remember that. The people that never really brought value to our lives, we won't even remember their names. Let's move three years ahead now and cut the bullsh*t out now. Let's move like we already advanced and that's what we're going to do. If I know I want to — Hey man, in the next five years, I may want to start playing golf. You know what? I'm not going to wait five years. We're going to start this year. Let's start working on the putt. 

You're right. You do need to change how you invest your time in order for your results to change. And that's like the main takeaway from that, right? Like a lot of people will just complain about something or they'll say, "Yeah, you know, I got to do this", but if you just take inventory of your time, you realize, "Wow, I'm actually wasting like two hours a day in meetings, listening to people complain, you know, whatever, solving dumb problems that shouldn't have happened."

Oh man, and you'll get better and better. And then you'll be surprised in three months how your life has changed. You'll be surprised. 

Ambition is the most important ingredient to success, which makes sense, so at least that's what you say in the book, right? And I wonder if you found this, it's really easy to assume that other people have the same level of ambition as you do, but statistically, that's just not going to be true, right?
It takes a certain amount of ambition. And the more ambition you have, the more things you can overcome.

So you're not like the bottom of this infrastructure, where if you, as the peg gets knocked down, for some reason, everybody else falls, you've got people who run car dealerships, beverage brands, you've got all kinds of different Wingstop, right? You got fast food joints, and these are all run independently by people that you trust. So if anything happens to any other element of your business — it's like the Internet. If one node goes down, the rest of the nodes, just take over. And it's like, nobody even has to notice that there's a problem. So you can get to fixing it.


Never think you've got it all figured out. Always have that beginner's mindset. The second you think you found a lane and you've got it all figured, you've just set a ceiling for yourself

But at the end of the day, I just want to make sure everybody's winning. So I keep everybody involved and I enjoy what I do, so it's always a good thing.
