Love comes and goes like the tide  
A force we can't predict or abide  
Sometimes it rushes in with a roar  
Other times it trickles, slow and unsure

It can be a fire that burns bright  
A flame that flickers in the night  
A feeling that warms the heart  
A spark that sets the world apart

But love can also fade away  
Like the mist that clears by day  
It can disappear without a trace  
Leaving us alone in a lonely place

Nobody knows how quickly or slow  
Love will come and love will go  
It's a mystery, a dance, a game  
A journey without a known end or aim

So hold tight to the love you find  
And cherish it in your heart and mind  
For love, like time, is fleeting and rare  
And should be treasured, always and everywhere
