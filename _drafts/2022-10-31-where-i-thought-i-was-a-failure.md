Where I thought I was broken  
I was simply in need of self-care and healing  

Where I thought I was unloveable  
I was simply in need of gaining self-confidence and stepping into a better version of myself  

Where I thought I was invisible  
I was simply in need of seeing myself more clearly and fully  

Where I thought I was ugly  
I was simply in need of appreciating my unique beauty  

Where I thought I was untalented  
I was simply in need of investing more effort in developing my gifts and abilities  

Where I thought I was stumbling and struggling  
I was simply undergoing a period of growth and transition  

Where I thought I was stagnating  
I was simply undergoing a periond of rest  

Where I thought I was lost  
I was simply finding my way  

Where I thought I was nobody  
I was simply awakening to who I truly was  

Where I thought I lacked purpose and meaning  
I was simply in need of focusing on things greater than myself  
And how I may use my abilities and talents to best serve and uplift humanity  

**And where I thought I was a failure**  
I was simply in need of shifting my focus and perspective  
From all of my past regrets, failures and mistakes  
To all of my learning, growth and progress  
And the future success I may achieve.
