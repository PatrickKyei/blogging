## In A Changing World

We are living in a very intriguing and strange age. 

Most economics and social scientists would agree that the world is changing around us. We are in the midst of an economic revolution that will radically alter our society in the same way that the industrial and agricultural revolutions did.

__The issue with situations like these is that they are difficult for a number of people to understand the dynamics of the changing times.__ 

They continue to hold on the old ways of getting results which is often difficult to break in the modern era.

If you go back a hundred years and look at diaries from the industrial revolution, you'll see people freaking out about how the world is changing and feeling utterly unsure.

## What Question Do You Ask Yourself?

And at the heart of these shifts are generally disputes about the meaning of productivity. 

Is it more productive for me to just generate reminders, or is it more effective for me to think and come up with a fantastic idea? Is it more productive for me to spend time with my family and be happy? 

A debate about productivity is taking place now in a way that our parents and grandparents did not have to deal with.

And it's quite fine for you to be concerned about it. 

You should not feel terrible about your anxiety. It's merely a feature of the time, but there is a solution. 

The solution is to figure out how to drive yourself to think more, to focus on the right goals, to goals that align with your interests, to become an innovation broker, and to construct mental models so you can focus better.
