How can one live life to the fullest?
Travel if you can. “Travelling leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller”.
Don’t compare yourself. Be happy with what you’ve got.
Take a moment or two to appreciate what you have every day.
See the good in everything. Even when it’s a setback.
Don’t be hard on yourself.
Take care of yourself.
Love more.
See through your own thoughts.
See family and friends when you can.
Grow.
Slow down a little.
Live.
Compliment someone. Compliment yourself.
Be yourself. Be happy with who you are.
Write. Read. Do more of what you love.
Build good habits.
And lastly, to live life to the fullest, just be present.

Cheers
