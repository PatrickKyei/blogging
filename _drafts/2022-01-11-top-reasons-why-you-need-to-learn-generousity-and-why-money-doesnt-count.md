> Stuff doesn't matter; in other words, costly things are great, but they don't count as much as the experiences you share with the people you care about.

I admire a fine leather jacket and a stylish bike, as well as a fancy bed frame and costly groceries; certainly, these things have some worth, but they are pale in comparison to spending time with people you truly care about. 

I know it sounds clich√©, and I know I say it all the time, but every year it becomes clearer and clearer to me that relationships, experiences, and acts of service are what truly counts in life. They're pretty much everything that matters in life.

I mean, you might be driving a Bugatti, which is pretty nice. Where do you intend to proceed with it? You can sit at a highly fine club for a long time, but who is sitting next to you?

Make meaningful experiences for oneself, if you understand what I mean. It doesn't have to be something monumental. Call your mum, call your dad, call your brother, sister, cousin, whoever it is, and go out for some Sunday 'fufu' (a native Ghanaian meal) this weekend. 

Ask your buddy how they are, and tell them how much they mean to you. Take a coworker out to lunch and tell them what made you proud this year. Email your boss, lecturer, or mentor and thank them for teaching you what they taught you. Plan a weekend getaway with your closest friend, take your mom out to lunch, go on a stroll with your dog, and invite two pals you haven't seen in a long time.

I guarantee you won't be sorry because the people we maintain in our lives, how we show up for them, how they show up for us, how we share our love, thoughts, and attention, are what makes life worthwhile.

All of the research on happiness backs this up. We know this in our bones, yet it's so easy to forget when we're caught up in our daily lives. So, my #1 piece of advice for you is to be generous with what you have right now. That is, whatever it is. It doesn't have to be money, a present, or a vacation - in fact, the less tangible the better - and it should be given to those you care about.

That is a huge secret, which isn't a secret at all. Simply give and see how far giving yourself to others can get you in life.
