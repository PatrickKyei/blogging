Trust the process of life, the universe and the self.

Always compare yourself to yourself. How you are today and yesterday. A fish cannot be compared to a rabbit.

Do not share about your personal life with everyone.

Everyday in the morning ,thank the universe for everything it has given you.

Don't use negative words in life because the law of attraction says like attracts like, so when you think a thought, you are also attracting like thoughts to you ,for example “I don't want a bad haircut “ is a negative sentence can be replaced with “i wanted a good haircut.“

Meditate everyday. Many thoughts will come in the mind during this moment, leave it there and move on.

Make a clear idea on what you want to do, if you work on it , you shall definitely see successful results.

Read Read Read. I realized the meaning of the quote - “A Good book is a good friend”. You will too.

Take time for yourself. Make yourself as your best friend. I have the most beautiful person in this world to listen everything I say her.
