## They choose to be happy

A mentally strong person understands that they are incapable of controlling other people’s actions. Thus, they always choose to be happy because that is the only thing one can control in life.

One of the things I tell myself in any situation I cannot control is that "It doesn't matter". After some time, my mind and my spirit gets it and they keep calm.

## They are not people pleasers

They know to put themselves first before others. They are not afraid to say no when someone oversteps their boundaries. They won’t feel pressured to attend an event that they are not interested in.

## They reflect often or at the end of the day

A mentally strong person is not perfect. They may have made some unreasonable choices a while ago. They may harbour feelings of inadequacy or jealousy towards a fellow coworker. What matters is that they take time to question their behaviour and emotions. Through self reflection, one is able to identify the issue at heart and tackle them with creative solutions.

## They tackle the difficult tasks first

One cannot be in a constant state of ignorance forever. Eventually, all these tasks will catch up to you, so address them quickly!
They deal with issues that must be dealt with at hand. They don't postpone important issues because they are hard. And because of that they are well built for hard times.

## They listen to their bodies

A healthy body equals a strong mind. Mentally strong people are mindful of what they take in their bodies. They are regular at the gym or engage in cardio exercises home. They go for a jog, they walk their dog around the neighborhood, they immerse themselve in nature.

## They don’t multitask

If you won’t do something right, don’t do it at all. Multitasking forces unnecessary stress and delay whilst completing the most mundane of tasks.
