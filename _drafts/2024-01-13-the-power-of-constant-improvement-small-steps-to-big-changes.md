MOST people want instant results.

90% of people are after instant success. The hard truth is that success is not a one day wonder.

The world is experiencing rapid advance in technology.

Information is growing at a faster rate. Social media is bringing the world closer.

The same blessing is a curse. Social media, Artificial Intelligence(AI), and rapid growth of information.

Social media is pushing the get rich quick lifestyle into our faces everyday.

20, 30 years ago if I was comparing myself to people, it would be like other guys in the office or like the kids I grew up with or other people in my community.

Now it's just everyone in the whole planet.

With the use of AI, companies can target individuals with ads and contents that glue them to their screens all day.

We cannot downplay the importance of social media in today's world. However we cannot also deny the other side of technology and social media.

The Internet is helping businesses and individuals to distribute products and services to a wider audience.

This is helping us solve most of humanity problems – hunger, access to quality education, economic instability etc.

Everything that happens on the Internet or with the use of the Internet has a ripple effect.

We see this happening with the number of successful men and women the internet is producing.

We can also see the impact these people are making in the world.

The challenge is that we cannot see the work that goes on in the background before we see the results over the internet.

Therefore we see them as an overnight success.

If nothing changes, nothing is going to change.

You have to understand that success is a little bit of tiny habits practiced every day over a long period of time.

To become the person that you want to become, you need to build your identity through consistent habits.

This is a gradual evolution.

We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new.

We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

Meaningful change does not require radical change.

Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big.

That’s the paradox of making small improvements.

Each time you get tiny results it teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself.

You start to believe you can actually accomplish newer and more challenging tasks.

Each time you practice a skill you are closer to becoming that person.

Each time you write a page, you are a writer.

Each time you practice the violin, you are a musician.

Each time you start a workout, you are an athlete.

Each time you write a line of code you are a developer.

The trick is not to do your best every day, the trick is to show up every day.

Read a chapter every day.

Write a page every day.

Build something small every day.

Be consistent.

People who preach quality before they start anything are often just lazy.

Quantity and iteration leads to real quality.

High quantity leads to high quality.

It took Thomas Edison the 1000th fail sequence to make the electric light bulb.

This is the feedback loop behind all human success:

try,

fail,

learn,

try differently.

Thank you for reading and enjoy the weekend.
