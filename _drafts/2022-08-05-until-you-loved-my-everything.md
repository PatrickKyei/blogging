_Your heart is going crazy..._

..._that's because it's scary dammit_

When we go through disappointments in a relationship we build a strong wall around our hearts as a form of self defense.

At some point we despise anything that has to do with love, relationships, commitment, friendship and family.

I was fine before you walked right through that door. And now I'm something more than I ever imagined.

I was so sure I didn't need anyone but you were something more than I ever imagined.

The good, the bad, the in-between, all of me.
