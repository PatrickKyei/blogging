> How successful are you if just one person is truly winning?

![put image here](https://imagelinkgoeshere.com)

Are you truly the most remarkable leader? 

No, it should influence everyone who comes to the table and contributes anything. It's straightforward. If you're the only one winning, you might not be winning at all.


Put yourself out there and have faith in your abilities. Treat everyone fairly and place individuals in positions where they may establish their own infrastructure and network." As if that were genuine guidance.

This is a value. I have a vision. Sometimes I roll the dice and I hit some lucky numbers.

Nobody is interested in your excuses. You don't have to be concerned about the situation; just go for it.

The moment you're anticipating does not exist. Everyone has issues. Some individuals use them as justifications. Others see them as opportunities. It is your attitude to those challenges that is important." How did you find out about that?

Man, if I could only be confident to know, "Hey man, one day, you're going to be great, man."

You must learn specific things about yourself, such as how to provide value for others, how to form a strong community or team, how to be a super fantastic leader, and so on. As a result, your motivation should be on a higher level, and you should be proud of it.

Be vibrant and energizing. You have history to write. And, to be honest, if it were about a dollar figure, we would have stopped a long time ago, but I believe it's more about making history.
 

How do you pick which habits, hobbies, or people to abandon? Because not everything will be geared at developing and strengthening your team. You know, sometimes you simply have pals, but I'm sure you have a rule of thumb for this sort of stuff.

Because just a few things will be important three years from now. As you put it, it's "fluff." I'm a big fan of fluff, that nonsense. We won't even recall it. We won't recall the names of the folks who never truly added worth to our lives. Let's jump ahead three years and eliminate the nonsense immediately. Let's move as if we've already advanced, and that's exactly what we're going to accomplish. If I know I want to — Hey, guy, I might want to start playing golf in the next five years. What do you think? I'm not going to see what happens for another five years. We'll get started this year. Let's get started on the putt.

You eventually realize I was correct. You must adjust how you invest your time if you want to see a difference in your outcomes. And isn't that the key point from this? Many people will simply complain about something or say, "Yeah, you know, I've got to do this," but if you take an inventory of your time, you'll realize, "Wow, I'm wasting like two hours a day in unnecessary group discussions, listening to people complain, you know, whatever, and solving dumb problems that shouldn't have happened."

Oh man, and you'll get better and better. And then you'll be surprised in three months how your life has changed. You'll be surprised. 

Ambition is the most crucial factor in achieving success, which seems logical, doesn't it? And I'm curious if you discovered this; it's very simple to think that other people have the same amount of ambition as you, but statistically, that's just not going to be the case, right?
It needs a certain level of determination. And the more ambitious you are, the more obstacles you will be able to conquer.

So you're not like the bottom of this infrastructure, where if one peg falls for any reason, everyone else falls. You have folks that attend your daily stand-up meetings and are in charge of uncovering fresh possibilities and bringing in talent, correct? You have many branches or components of the firm or product you are working on that are operated independently by individuals you trust. So, if something goes wrong with any other aspect of your organization — it's like the Internet, if one node goes down, the rest of the nodes just take over. And it's almost as if no one has to realize that there's an issue. So you can start to work on correcting it.


Never believe you have everything figured out. Maintain a beginner's attitude at all times. You've just created a ceiling for yourself the moment you believe you've discovered a lane and have it all figured out.

> At the end of the day, I just want to make sure that everyone wins. So I keep everyone engaged, and I like what I do, so it's always a win-win situation.
