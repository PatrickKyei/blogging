> It is transformational when someone teaches you how to be purposeful about your thoughts, how to take charge of your life and your brain.

## A Changing World

We are living in a very intriguing and strange epoch. Most economics and social scientists would agree that the world is changing around us. We are in the midst of an economic revolution that will radically alter our society in the same way that the industrial and agricultural revolutions did.

__The issue with situations like these is that they are stressful.__ If you go back a hundred years and look at diaries from the industrial revolution, you'll see people freaking out about how the world is changing and feeling utterly unsure.

## What Question Do You Ask Yourself?

And at the heart of these shifts are generally disputes about the meaning of productivity. Is it more productive for me to just generate reminders, or is it more effective for me to think and come up with a fantastic idea? Is it more productive for me to spend time with my family and be happy? A debate about productivity is taking place now in a way that our parents and grandparents did not have to deal with.

And it's quite fine for folks to be concerned about it. They should not feel terrible about their anxiety. It's merely a feature of the time, but there is a solution. The solution is to figure out how to drive yourself to think more, to focus on the right goals, to create to-do lists correctly, to become an innovation broker, and to construct mental models so you can focus better.

## Going Headfirst At The Problem

For the first time, we have a good enough understanding of how the brain works to be able to control our thoughts and become more effective. Teaching oneself to think more helps to alleviate anxiety. Because once you have power over your thoughts, there is nothing you can't accomplish.

Making a decision that gives you a sense of control makes it much simpler to engage the areas of your brain that govern motivation, which works extremely well for little activities.

## Making Your Thought Process More Intentional

I believe there is a basic lesson here, which is that we are living in a time of rapid change and it is all too easy to become so distracted that you stop being productive.

And you might get so preoccupied that you lose the ability to focus on what is truly essential.

When we say that understanding how to think is just as important as knowing what to think about, we're talking about lessons on how to structure our thinking and create routines that help us to stay focused on the most important things.

> Routines that we build essentially give us the space to think about the right things.

The thing that differentiates the most productive individuals from everyone else is that they have these routines that force them to think about what's happening a little bit more.

So, in addition to every morning, one of my major contemplative habits is to write down my thinking process, record thoughts that come to me, and subsequently put it somewhere I can see it and think about it a little bit more.

> I've discovered that writing down my thoughts helps me comprehend why I have that idea; it forces me to think a little more thoroughly, such as, "why did I believe this method was right?" And while they might be difficult at times, they have proven to be the most significant.

## The Common Difficult Desire

You know, one of the major difficulties in modern life is that we all want to think more, right? Nobody says, "I wish I was thinking less about the essential things each day," but one of the problems is that we frequently get so caught up that we forget to think.

Not because we dislike thinking, but because there are always a thousand items on your to-do list before you can think about the matter at hand or your priorities.

> Many times, we learn things but do not retain them.

One of the things we've discovered is that the most productive people have this type of check-in mechanism. Where they will regularly set aside two hours on certain daysÂ and say, "For these two hours, I'm going to look at what occurred in the past week and I'm going to plan the future week," or they will have a regular lunch once every three weeks with one of their greatest friends.

And during that dinner, they always do the same thing: they speak about what's happened in the past three weeks, the finest ideas they've been exposed to, and they explain those ideas. Then they talk about what they're looking forward to in the following three weeks. We conceive of those as things we do in our social freedom, right? That we share ideas with our friends in order to educate them. But what's really going on is that we're educating ourselves. We're recalling the most important ideas.

We're rephrasing that concept in such a manner that it pushes us to make sense of it, to understand how it connects with our lives and how we might apply it.

## Take-Away

People who understand the repercussions of their acts, who understand how to control their own thoughts and actions, are the ones who participate in these meditative routines the most. They have these routines, these habits that drive them to consider what is truly going on. And it's a strategy that pays off in the long term.
