> When someone teaches you how to think about thinking, when someone teaches you how to like take control of your life and your brain, it's transformative.

We are living through this really interesting and weird time. Like the world is literally changing around us and for years I was skeptical when people would say everything's different now, but most economists, most social scientists, they agree. We are living through an economic revolution that will leave our society as profoundly changed as the industrial revolution did and the agrarian revolution. The thing about times like this is they are very anxiety producing. If you go and you look at diaries from a hundred years ago during the industrial revolution, what you'll see is you will see people freaking out about how the world is changing and feeling completely uncertain.

And at the core of these changes are usually debates over the definition of productivity. Is it more productive for me just to create widgets or is it more productive for me to sit and daydream and come up with a brilliant idea? Or is it more productive for me to spend time with my kids and be happy? A debate over productivity is happening now in a way that our parents, our grandparents didn't really have to experience. And the fact that people feel anxious about that, that is okay. They shouldn't feel bad about feeling anxious. It's just a characteristic of this period, but there is an answer to it. The answer to it is to figure out how to push yourself to think more, how to push yourself to focus on the right goals, and to write to-do lists the right way, and to become an innovation broker, and to build mental models so you can focus better. For the first time, we actually understand how the brain works well enough that we can govern our thinking in a way to become more successful. Teaching yourself to think more, that relieves the anxiety. Because once you are in control of how you think, there's nothing that you can't get done

By making a choice that makes you feel in control, it's much easier to activate those parts of your neurology, where motivation resides, and that works really well for small tasks.

I mean, I think there's a basic lesson, which is that we are living through a period of rapid change and economic revolution on parts of the agrarian and industrial revolutions and also a revolution in culture. It is possible to become so busy that you've stopped being productive.

And you can become so busy that you lose the capacity to focus on those things that are actually important. 

That you'll have time to really focus on the things that matter. And so when we talk about knowing how to think as much as what we think about, what we're really talking about is these lessons from neurology and from psychology and from behavioral economics that tell us how to structure our thinking, how to build what psychologists refer to as contemplative routines that allow us to stay focused on the things that matter the most.

So contemplative routines are essentially habits that we build that give us the space to think about the right thing

It's any habit that we get into that pushes us to think a little bit more. The thing that distinguishes the most productive people from everyone else is that they have these habits that push them to think a little bit more about what's going on.

So for me, one of my big contemplative routines besides every morning, is sort of write my thought process down, documents ideas that pop up im my head and later post it somewhere I can regualarly see and think about a little bit more. 

I have found that for me, pending down my thoughts helps me to understand my hold that idea, it pushes me to think a little bit more deeply about like, why did I think this process was right? And sometimes they're hard, but that ended up being the most meaningful. 

You know, one of the big challenges in contemporary life is that simply all of us want to think more, rigeht? There's nobody out there who says, "I really wish I was thinking less about the important things each day," and yet one of the challenges is that oftentimes we get so wrapped up that we forget to think.
Not because we don't like thinking, but because there's always a thousand things on your to-do list before you think about the problem in front of you, or think about your priorities.

There are so many times we really learn things and we just don't absorb them. 

Well, one of the things that we find is the most productive people, they tend to have this kind of check in system. Where very frequently on a Sunday afternoon, they'll set aside two hours and they'll say, "For these two hours, I'm going to look at what happened in the past week and I'm going to plan the coming week," or they have a regular meal once every three weeks with one of their best friends. And at that meal, they do the same thing every time they talk about what's happened in the last three weeks, the best ideas that they've been exposed to and they describe those ideas. And then what they're excited about, that's coming up in the next three weeks. We think of those things as things that like our social opportunities, right? That we tell our friends about ideas because we want to educate them. But what's actually happening is that we're educating ourselves. We're remembering the most important idea. We're rephrasing that idea in a way that forces us to make sense of it, to see how it actually interacts with our life and how we can use it. 

And the people who recognize what implications their behaviors have, the people who recognize how to discipline their own thoughts and their own actions, those are the people who tend to engage more in these contemplative routines. They tend to have these practices, these habits that force them to think about what's really going on. And that really pays off over the long run.
