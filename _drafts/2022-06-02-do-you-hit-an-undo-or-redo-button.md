When we run into an outcome that we don't like, our first instinct can be to erase the whole thing and start over. But that's not always the right thing to do. Instead of an **undo**, let's go for a **redo.**

This allows us to make a new decision that factors both learning from the outcome we weren't happy with, plus and deeper understanding of our inner drivers.
