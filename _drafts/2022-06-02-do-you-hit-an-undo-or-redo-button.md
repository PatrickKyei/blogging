When we come into an outcome that we don't like, our immediate reaction may be to remove everything and start over. However, this isn't always the best option.

Let's do a **redo** instead of a **undo**.

This enables us to make a new decision that takes into account both what we learned from the outcome we didn't like and a better knowledge of our inner drivers.

> Decisions aren't the end, they are only the beginning.

As we grow older, we realize that our decisions have consequences. Depending on who we are and what situations we are in, these outcomes manifest in various ways. So, despite the fact that we know our lives revolve around the decisions we make on a daily basis, most of us still struggle with making decisions.

As a result, we tend to put off making decisions in our life that are supposed to get us from point A to point B. Now, it's our inner conflicts that keep us from making these critical judgments, not things like creativity or intelligence or even figuring out the ideal decision-making procedure. The feeling of not **being good enough**; the **fear of disappointing others**, these are the feelings that get in the way of us making crucial decisions.

The fear of not being able to undo one's mistakes after making a poor decision frequently stands in the way of making confident decisions. We dread making decisions even more when we think the implications of our actions will harm other individuals we love and care about, rather than simply ourselves.

Adopting the mindset that we are not good choice makers and that we may improve our decision-making skills as we make more decisions and learn from them is a good place to start.
