HABITS

What you do, how you do it, and when you do it determine whether you're going to be successful or not.

Habits align with the values you've adopted and depict your quality of life. It determines whether you're going to be productive or not whereas, your success lies in how you manage your time whether effectively or otherwise.

Success is a product of good values, habits and time management. If you can have these, if you don't succeed, you will be very successful. You may fail in the process but you will never end up a failure.

I hope this helps.

Keep Thriving!
