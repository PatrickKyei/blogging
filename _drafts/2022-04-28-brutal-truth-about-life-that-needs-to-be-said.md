1. Some people die at 25. We just bury them at 75. You will come certain people who have completely lost it to life. No matter how much hope you try to instill in them, no matter how many times you try to wake up them and they are not ready to respond to any call to life.

It is not your duty to spend all your time and effort on such people. Spend time on those who respond to your call and waste time on those who are ready to be helped.

2. Quitters never win and winners never quit.

3. Sometimes the only person who can help you, is YOU.

PUSH yourself because no one is going to do it with for you. People are often willing to push you only when you start the pushing. Your life is fully your responsibility, whatever you wish for yourself go for it. You are the only one who knows how badly you want it.

4. You are both of light and the dark. You don’t have to deny any aspects of who you are.

5. Control your ANGER because it’s just one letter away from ‘D’ANGER.
Anger is an emotion  and it supposed to be a message to us about what is going on in our body. But if we do not learn how to handle that message, it can be a great destroyer.

Don't let your emotions make the decisions. Try not to let your emotions get the best of you.

6. You will always recycle your experiences until you change your thinking.

Our thoughts have a lot of influence over our lives. There's a quote that says, “A man is shaped by his thoughts” and I agree with that. You have to develop the habit of thinking positively and filtering out negative thoughts.

7. Life is supposed to be difficult, but it doesn’t need to be painful.

No matter how good your life is, you will one day face the realities of it; the hard part.
