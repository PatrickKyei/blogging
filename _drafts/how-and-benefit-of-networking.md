because it keeps you focused on the only thing that matters, which is value, kindness, love, as corny as it sounds, all that fundamental stuff. So don't beat yourself up too much for these thoughts. They're normal. But once you understand how really great relationships operate, you can then use those thoughts to check back in with yourself, get clear on why you are reaching out to a certain person, make sure you're leading in the right spirit, and then you can use these limiting thoughts to become a better friend, a better peer, a better colleague, which by the way is exactly how I learned this stuff myself.

[01:00:25] Gabriel, it's funny, I do talk to people occasionally who are like, "I don't know, it feels corny," and what I happen to notice about those people because I sometimes will boomerang their email for like six months.

[01:00:35] Gabriel Mizrahi: Mm-hmm.

[01:00:35] Jordan Harbinger: They're always stuck. And this is correlation is not causation kind of thing.

[01:00:40] Gabriel Mizrahi: Mm-hmm.

[01:00:40] Jordan Harbinger: But I can't help but notice the person who never gets their business off the ground, that constantly runs into walls, that finds themselves always getting the short end of the stick. I'm like, "Well, you are the one who just complained to me in my email inbox about how when you try to use people, it works, but you don't bother with the rest of Six-Minute Networking because you only reach out when you need something and it feels disingenuous to give a sh*t about anyone else." And I'm like, "Surprise, surprise. You're not winning."

[01:01:06] Gabriel Mizrahi: Mmm.

[01:01:06] Jordan Harbinger: Because everybody can feel that. You actually just reach out to them when you need something. It would almost be better to be disingenuous and go through the motions while you get used to actually learning to care about other people besides yourself.

[01:01:19] Gabriel Mizrahi: Right.

[01:01:37] Jordan Harbinger: But these people are like, "I'm not going to fake it because I don't need to, and I don't care. I just can't." And then they say, "Oh, it's because I don't want to feel disingenuous." And it's like, "Oh my God, you're really, really bad at this." So I don't know. Look, you can get good at this if you try, and you should because it's changed my whole life. But if you don't bother and you're saying, "Oh, it doesn't feel authentic," I think that's an easy way out. I think you're just giving yourself a pass. And when you suffer the consequences on this, don't blame anybody but yourself. You're not immune to the consequences of ignoring this. You're just being ignorant of this secret game that's being played around you.

[01:02:10] So hope you all enjoyed that. I want to thank everybody who wrote in this week and everybody who listened. Thank you so much. Don't forget to check out the episode with Adam Bornstein if you haven't done so yet.

[01:02:19] And speaking of good relationship building, I'd be a terrible marketer if I didn't mention our Six-Minute Networking course, which is free over on the Thinkific platform at jordanharbinger.com/course. You can't make up for lost time when it comes to relationships, the number one mistake I see people make students, entrepreneurs, whoever it is, is kicking the can down the road, postponing it, not digging the well before they get thirsty, and not doing it, at least what somewhat amounts to a genuine fashion. Once you need relationships, you're too late to make them, period. It's not something you can do when you need it in the moment. Fart around and find out as the kids say. This is the stuff I wish I knew 20 years ago because it's changed my whole life. It's been crucial. It's not fluff. Again, it's free, jordanharbinger.com/course.

They are levers of influence. They just flick a switch and we respond automatically. Liking is one of the universal principles of influence because it works so well and so broadly across all these situations. There is also something called a horns effect, just as there's a halo effect where everything around you, if you're good looking. If there's something negative about you, people then associate other negative things with you. So we have to be sure that our first encounters with people are very positive.

[01:05:00] When you go into a new situation, when you don't know very much about the people that you're dealing with, expect the best from them. That allows you to be generous. And the consequence of being generous hits on three of the principles. First of all, people like you more. Secondly, they reciprocate the generosity with generosity of their own. And when they've done that, when they've given to you, they've made a decision about making a commitment to your partnership. It's costless and the other thing it does, besides producing a gift that you've given to people and the obligation to give back, that goes with it, you've established yourself as an authority. And authority is another one of the universal principles of influence. Whatever your business is, you give first.
