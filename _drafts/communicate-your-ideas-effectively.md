## Why Mind Mapping Is Useful

Mind mapping is a helpful tool for exploring ideas and looking for associations and connections. Mind mapping can either be used to explore something that you already know, an existing structure, or explore a completely new idea that you're just trying to get as many ideas out as possible. It's not a complicated process, but sometimes it's a refreshing way to look at information.

A lot of the time, these processes might get a little bit messy. You can start over, but it's also okay to make mistakes, cross things out, and just have something be imperfect. So, starting with your life, you might wanna think about your interests, your passions, your schooling, your work experience.

## How To Create A Mindmap

So, to start, again, pen and paper, my favorite tools. It's often helpful to start with a subject matter that you know well. So, I recommend starting with yourself. So what you wanna do is put your name in the middle of the page in a circle. Starting in the middle and then working out. In general I like to work in a clockwise fashion, but again, all these techniques you're gonna figure out ways to adapt them for you and what works best for you.

Go ahead and create spokes coming out from the middle of the circle to highlight these different areas of interest. One of the reasons I really love mind mapping is it helps you find associations you might not have made otherwise.

A simple way to mind map is by to start by putting a subject in the middle of the page. From there, you can draw spokes out from the main ideas and write words or draw pictures at the end of each one. You can continue drawing spokes out from each new idea/image, or connect existing ones by drawing lines between them. Of course, this method can be adapted to suit your own personal style. As long you write down words, images, or ideas and connect them, youâ€™re following the mind-mapping method!

## Storyboards

Storyboards are a great way to explore ideas and experiences in a visual manner. Once again, it's not about being a great artist. Storyboards are about communicating ideas.
