## Comparing yourself to others

Joy comes from advancement, not comparison.

## Arguing with others

You might win the argument, but you won’t change their mind, so what’s the point.

## Negative news (which is mostly all news)

Unless you’re going to do something about it, you’re only polluting your mind. And if you share the news with others, you’re polluting theirs too.

## People who like to complain, blame, condemn, and criticize

## Procrastination

It only leads to misery. But if you act, you shine. And if you act consistently, you’ll be unstoppable.

## Settling. Never settle

The only limits in your life are the ones you put on yourself, so dream big, and be bold.

## Doubting yourself

If you do, you’ll attract reasons to support your claims.

## Staying on your Smartphone in important conversations

## Aimless social media browsing

## Working without breaks
