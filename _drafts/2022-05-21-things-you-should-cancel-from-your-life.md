## Comparing yourself to others

> Comparison destroys character.

Stop comparing yourself to people who started ten years ago before you. Focus own your joureny.

There's nothing wrong if you have to draw inspiration from the journey of those successfull people in your life. But do not bug your thoughts around why they are doing better than you or have what you don't have. Focus on improving yourself and becoming better instead.

Joy comes from advancement, not comparison.

## Arguing with others



You might win the argument, but you won’t change their mind, so what’s the point.

## Negative news (which is mostly all news)

Unless you’re going to do something about it, you’re only polluting your mind. And if you share the news with others, you’re polluting theirs too.

## People who like to complain, blame, condemn, and criticize

## Procrastination

It only leads to misery. But if you act, you shine. And if you act consistently, you’ll be unstoppable.

## Settling. Never settle

The only limits in your life are the ones you put on yourself, so dream big, and be bold.

## Doubting yourself

Self doubt kills more dreams than failure does.

Whatever you want do, if it is worth pursuing, start now.

Start where you are. Start with fear. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start with voice trembling, but start.

If you do, you’ll attract reasons to support your claims.

You have what it takes, don't ever doubt.


## Staying on your Smartphone in important conversations
