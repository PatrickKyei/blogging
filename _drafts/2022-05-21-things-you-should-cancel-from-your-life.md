Comparing yourself to others. Joy comes from advancement, not comparison.
Arguing with others. You might win the argument, but you won’t change their mind, so what’s the point.
Negative news (which is mostly all news). Unless you’re going to do something about it, you’re only polluting your mind. And if you share the news with others, you’re polluting theirs too.
People who like to complain, blame, condemn, and criticize.
Procrastination. It only leads to misery. But if you act, you shine. And if you act consistently, you’ll be unstoppable.
Settling. Never settle. The only limits in your life are the ones you put on yourself, so dream big, and be bold.
Never doubt yourself. If you do, you’ll attract reasons to support your claims.
Bringing smartphones to the bedroom.
A career that doesn’t inspire you.
Refined sugar.
Alcohol.
Less than 8 hours of sleep.
An uncomfortable bed (1/3 of your life spent there!!!)
Aimless social media browsing.
Working too much (spend more time with those you love instead).
