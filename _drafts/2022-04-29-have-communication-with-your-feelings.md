Is really about your relationship with your feelings. Your feelings are really not something to fix. Emotions aren't something that you need to get rid of. In fact it's the opposite.

The feelings you have, you have to acknowledge them in order to function properly because what is probably happening is that you've been stuffing them down for so long they're coming out wherever they can. In this case in difficult conversations at work.

The thing about emotions is the harder you try to control them the more they actually control you. So if you're going to work on this it won't be by suppressing or hiding from your feelings, it'll be by giving them more air time in your life and your close relationships and definitely in some therapy.

You're never going to get rid of your emotions but you can change your relationship with your emotions so you can process them differently so they won't control your life in the way that they are right.

Explore what you learned about emotions growing up maybe somewhere along the line you were judged for your feelings, maybe punished for them or perhaps blamed for them in some way or just grew up in a house where you weren't allowed a lot of those feelings. That will do it too or maybe the bullying that you mentioned really did do a number on you and you learned how to shut down those feelings as a way to survive or maybe you soaked up some cultural stuff about you know how men are supposed to deal with their feelings. Just stuff them down and then they're not an issue all of these things are very common but these are the early formative experiences that lead somebody to not have this relationship with their feelings. That's what I would dig into.

These feelings you're avoiding they're not quite as bad as you think I get that they feel so intense but the judgment, the self-loving that's causing so much more suffering than just the baseline feelings so if you want relief here there's really only one option.

You're going to have to start talking and you're going to have to start feeling definitely. This guy thinks emotions make you weak which so many men do right but really all they do is make you human and but not only are these feelings perfectly normal but there's also no such thing as a good or bad feeling.

According to her there's only the meaning we ascribe to those feelings. I thought that was a pretty important reminder.

Like this guy gets angry or sad about something and he interprets that is bad which means he should stuff that feeling down because it's somehow not right.

Feeling is what it is. It's neither good nor bad, it's just a feeling. And we gets to decide what to make of it, what to do with it exactly plus stuffing down your emotions all the time that takes a ton of energy.

 It is exhausting and not probably makes him even more sensitive to them.
And you can be probably drained from all of the suppression.

Yeah for sure so time to start a feeling man I know you don't want to but it's your only option.

When I tell you that acknowledging this stuff and exploring it with somebody you trust; that's going to be way easier than spending a lot of energy suppressing them. It might be scary but it'll be liberating and it'll open up a whole new world for you plus it'll save you a lot of time wasting on hiding them. you You've got this.
