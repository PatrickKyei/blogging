I like to compare how the brain operates to a computer. The brain controls all human functions and ensures a smooth running of day to day tasks. Much of human innovation is inspired by nature and human interactions with the natural world. From the invention of aeroplanes which are inspired by birds to the inventions of submarines inspired by fishes, ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Build Mental Mastery II</title><link href="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-mental-mastery-part-2/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Build Mental Mastery II" /><published>2024-06-29T07:35:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-06-29T21:23:25+00:00</updated> <id>https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-mental-mastery-part-2/</id> <content src="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-mental-mastery-part-2/" /> <author> <name>Patrick Kyei</name> </author> <category term="Mindset" /> <category term="Self Improvement" /> <summary> Read the first part of this Letter here. This a second part of a 2 part series. Unto our conversation from last week: Your mind is a supercomputer and your attention is the RAM. Thoughts, regrets and tasks are the program slowing your performance. Learn, build, expand to focus your mind. If you do not improve your mind, you cannot improve your life. To change your life, first what cont... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Build Mental Mastery</title><link href="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-mental-mastery/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Build Mental Mastery" /><published>2024-06-22T07:35:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-06-22T21:15:50+00:00</updated> <id>https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-mental-mastery/</id> <content src="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-mental-mastery/" /> <author> <name>Patrick Kyei</name> </author> <category term="Mindset" /> <category term="Self Improvement" /> <summary> There will be a continuation of this Letters next week. This is a 1/2 of the mental mastery Letters. Look out for an update to this Letter next week. The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. —Mi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Build A Personal Brand</title><link href="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-a-personal-brand/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Build A Personal Brand" /><published>2024-06-15T07:35:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-06-15T07:35:00+00:00</updated> <id>https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-a-personal-brand/</id> <content src="https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-a-personal-brand/" /> <author> <name>Patrick Kyei</name> </author> <category term="Business" /> <category term="Internet" /> <summary> Last week I wrote to you to build whatever you want. You might ask, “But Patrick, i don’t know what to build.” Okay I heard you. Let’s start with your personal brand. I am going to give you a blueprint you can use to build a personal brand that is going to to be the key to unlock many areas of your life for you.

I was curious about why this happened but I didn’t really bother to ask anybody. I felt it wasn’t any serious thing to trouble anyone about. It was until I grew up that I understood why this happens during one of our science class. Hold on a little with the plant thing for me. I will tell... </summary> </entry> </feed>
