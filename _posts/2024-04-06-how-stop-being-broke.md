7 years ago, I was broke with 0 influence and 0 career opportunities.

The way to stop being broke is to learn a high-value skill, build a strong online presence, sell a product, your skills, or offer a unique service.

Expand what you do.

Growing up I noticed a trend that made me question what career path I wanted to pursue in life.

I saw people work into jobs they hated.  
Retire at 60 and live a boring lifestyle the rest of their lives.

I literally remember one neighbor who would curse all day because his kids had not sent him or delayed his allowance for the month. He literally depended on his kids for everything.

In primary school I saw most of my colleagues answer "What do you want to become in future" to the same job this man did before he retired.

This sparked my curiosity and so I started looking into myself to identify what I am passionate about and can pursue as a career.

I was constantly questioning myself on what other paths I can take that will not end me up at the same place as our neighbor.

I was aware of only one path in life:

Go to school.  
Get a decent job.  
Retire at 60 years young.  
Have enough money to survive and die.

I was in my 19's when my curiosity led me to the city.  
When I moved from my small town to the city I met many people making millions online and traveling the world with their laptops but never I looked into how they actually did it.

Until one day, when a friend I made at a meetup reached out to me and asked if I wanted to start a business with him.

I said, "How are we going to do this?"

He asked me, "What skillset do you have that you're really good at and is your first choice?"

I said, "communication design ( design and communication)."

He said, "I want you to enroll in a design course and let's start a business"


I spent 6 months online behind my computer to learn high value skills and build an online presence.

4 years later, we’ve made a huge trajectory.  
We helped other people who were lost in their career to find a high paying job, discover their passion and land international offers.

How?

The only way to stop being broke is to learn high-value skills, build your online presence, sell a product, your skills, or offer a unique service.

The world is an interconnected village.  
Traditional employment models are no longer the only path to financial security.

If you have the internet and digital technology, there are endless opportunities to create income streams and build wealth on your terms.

A laptop is a machine that you can use to earn money, sitting anywhere in the world, as long as it is connected to the internet.

## Step 1: Learn - Invest In Yourself

Invest in yourself.

Acquire high-value skills that are in demand in the marketplace.

Whether it's coding, marketing, communication design, sales or copywriting, mastering a valuable skill set opens doors to life time opportunities.

2 rules for a great life:

- Learn what can’t be taught in schools
- Do what can’t be replaced in work

You are not where you want to be because you are not the type of person who is supposed to be there.

Being inexperienced and willing to learn is better than being experienced and thinking you know it all.

There's a gap between your current self and your future self; bridge the gap with self education and personal experience.

7 years ago I started with:
- no skill.
- directionless.
- spending money on things I didn't need.

Then I enrolled in a design course and got my first client.

Today I:
- own a startup.
- giving others skills.
- can monetize anything.

This is how life changes.

1 decision!

1. Pick something you like. Don't follow trends, choose a skill that excites you.

2. Start small. Just 15 minutes a day is enough to make progress.

3. Don't sweat mistakes. Focus on learning, not being perfect.

You can create a career for yourself by doing just what you love doing.

## Step 2: Build - Start a Project

Most people use learning as a way to feel good about making progress when, in reality, they aren't learning or making progress. If you don't have a project, business, or purpose to apply what you learn, you are lost.

You need a project to build.

Something that you can invest your focus into. Something that has more gravity than distractions. Something that will bring you one level closer to the life you want.

People who learn to build are people who attain personal and financial freedom.

It is your job to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.

If you don’t know what to build, start with:
- what you already use, but make it better.
- a problem you’ve solved in your life.
- building what you want to see in the world.

If you want to be the person that creates wealth solve problems.

If you have solved a problem in your life, and other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it.

- build in the morning
- learn in the afternoon
- use the evening to replenish energy

Study less, build more, and your skill set will be forced to grow.

## Step 3: Expand - Build Leverage

Leverage the internet to build your online presence and showcase your expertise to the world.

Create a professional website, establish a strong presence on social media platforms, and consistently produce valuable content that demonstrates your knowledge and skills.

To make any kind of money in today's internet world, you must deliver substantial value, build a brand that people trust, and be authentic.

### 1. Build a brand

An audience or readership or just distribution in general is how you get a job without a job board, sell a book without a publisher, and make music without a record deal.

Build a personal brand that talks about your interest and shows your authentic self.

People are starting to realize that personal brands have more influence than any other kind of lead generation mechanism.

That’s what a personal brand is. A lead generation mechanism for your products or services.

The cool thing is, all you do is talk about your interests, what you are learning, and your expertise.

People want to work with you because they connect with you on a human level.

Pick 1 social media platform you spend most of your time on.

- create content around your niche as value
- post content and promote your products or services
- build your brand and
- ensure your profile and activity clearly communicate the value
- get seen

That’s how you will navigate and succeed in the internet business game.

Be you, learn to persuade and you get to skip ahead of those that lack distribution.


### 2. Monetize

Once you have built your digital presence, explore various avenues to monetize your expertise.

You can sell digital products  
Launch an e-book or online course  
Offering consulting services  
Freelance in your area of expertise

People buy with emotion then justify with logic.  
Sell the transformation not the product.  
It's easier to sell something that solves a pain than fulfills a desire.  
Whatever business you're in, study psychology and body language.


When dollars start hitting your account expand your offerings and explore new opportunities.

Continuously seek ways to innovate and add value to your offerings, and be open to adapting to changing market dynamics.

When I was starting out I had no one to tell me this was the only way to build faster online.

I wouldn't have spent too much time trying to wait on people to help me get a job or help me with something to get by.

If you didn't note down anything at all, this should get you started.

How to not stay broke:

If you hate working long hours:
- Learn a high impact skill
- Finally start a business
- Work on it for 1 hour each day
- Fire your boss from your life
- Work whenever you want

You will never work less if you don’t create your own way of doing so.

Hope this helps. Talk soon.
