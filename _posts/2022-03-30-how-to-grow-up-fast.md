## Learn What Independence Means

Nothing can teach us more than our own personal experiences.

It doesn't matter how big your new apartment is, move out of your parents' house and start living alone. The point is that living alone forces you to take charge of your own future. Strive for the transition from "freedom from" to "freedom to".

## Be Responsible

Being responsible has different connotations depending on your culture, but my greatest definition of responsibility is the ability to respond to whatever obstacles that come your way. You mature as a result of overcoming obstacles.

## Take Risks Now

Every day, think to yourself, "I have nothing to lose." You don't get up every day playing it safe; instead, you work hard and think strategically. The biggest Risk is not taking any Risk.

## Fail Fast, Fail Forward

Life isn't supposed to be comfortable. Congratulations if you try and fail. The majority of people will not even try it.

Fail quickly and quickly learn from your mistakes. When you fail quickly and learn from it, you progress, but if you dodge failure and play safe, you stay the same.

## Learn From Experts In Your Field

Build a team with the same dreams. Make friends with people who are significantly older than you, ask them questions, and you will have no excuse to struggle through your own life. Learning from other people's mistakes is the most useful approach to progress.

## Be Present

Wherever you are be present, stay present, drag your future into your present.

## Stay away from any blame games.

You owe no one an explanation for your failures and mistakes, so why should you blame others for your life's difficulties?

This life is 100% your responsibility. Remain tough!

## Keep The Forward Movement

Make a plan to keep you moving in life. This is why you should meditate, journal, establish plans, and stick to them.

## Act on Time

Finishing your unfinished task "First thing first" is the most effective approach of not wasting time.
