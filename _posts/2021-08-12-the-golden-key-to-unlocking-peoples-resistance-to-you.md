## The Narcissist Behavior

We are all self absorbed by nature: we are narcissist. This is a concept that people don't automatically accept and they resist that notion. We want to think that "*the other person is the narcissist and that I am not*". But we are all narcissist, we are all on the spectrum. We all think first and foremost of ourselves.

But some people are so low on the spectrum, they are so deeply narcissistic that they can not ever rise up: they can't think about other people. Their need is to constantly have attention.

So normally our way of dealing with our own self absorption and our own need for attention from other people is to create a self that we love, that we respect. We like ourselves to some degree we think that we are worthy of something. And whenever something bad happens we are at least able to revert this idea that we are actually a person that is good that we love.

A deep narcissist doesn't have that sense. They can't get attention or validation or a feeling of security from themselves. It can only come from other people. So they become masters at getting attention from been very dramatic, from stirring up a lot  of trouble so that the attention comes to them. And they can be extremely dangerous once you get entwined with them. Because people who are deeply narcissist don't view you as a human being, they view you as an object that they can use to further their agenda. And so they can cause a lot of trouble in ones life.

### How To Influence Others

People generally have an opinion about themselves. And you must extremely be aware of this. This is one of the most critical laws of human nature. And there are three universals for this opinion of ourselves.

***We usually like to think that we are autonomous and independent:*** that we make our decisions with our own willpower. That we are not forced to do what we do: "When I bought that new car, it was because I loved it, not because of advertisers".

***We also like to think that we are intelligent**.*

We may not think we are Einstein, but we know our field; we are not stupid. The sense that we are stupid and people are making fun of our intelligence is pretty difficult for us to accept.

***And thirdly that we are generally a good person**.*

We like to think that we have good intentions, we are kind, we are angelic. We are not mean spirited or ugly.

People want to feel those three qualities about themselves.

Then there is the flip side; people who don't have that. Who feel that they are not worthy, that they are not so intelligent and they are not a good person. They walk around with this opinion and it dominates them, it becomes who they are: your idea of yourself becomes who you are.

### Accept People The Way They Present Themselves

If you go around challenging people's opinion of who they are, you are going to have a lot of misery and trouble and you won't get very far. If you say something that questions their autonomy and makes them feel like they are manipulated, or when you say some remark that in an argument it makes them feel like they are stupid or a remark that makes them feel that they are not a nice person, a door that was closed to you will never open again and you may have made a silent enemy.

We've all had the experience of feeling depressed and life isn't very fair. We may probably not be doing very well and someone comes to say, "Oh come on the sun is shining, everything is great, you are really wonderful": we don't like to hear that. Because this is not what we feel at that moment, we feel something else. And they are trying to almost argue against the mood at the moment.

So you need to be aware of the fact that people have their own inner reality; their own way of thinking about themselves. And instead of inadvertently challenging it, you want to validate their opinion of who they are.

That gives you room now to influence and move them.

*So if you make them comfortable; if you make them feel that they are actually a good person, they are intelligent, that they are autonomously independent, they will lower their resistance to you.*

### Now you have the room to infiltrate another idea

So to take for example a person who does low self esteem, if you don't fight it and you say, "You are right. People have not treated you well. You know you haven't got a lot of good things in life. Your life has been really hard." And then they agree, there is a connection that they feel that you understand them. Now you can insinuate a comment that can help try to maybe raise their self esteem. And you can infiltrate later and say something like: "Yes it's true, but you know you actually have done 'this or that' in your life and it's not so bad."

If you begin by confirming that they had had a rough time and they have the right to kinda feel bad about themselves, now you can try to say something else that they are not so resistant to you and they are open to another possibility.

This is the golden key to unlocking people's natural resistance to you. If you always approach them as an individual with their own opinion about themselves, you try to unlock and see how you can validate that opinion and how you can feed what they want to hear, there's nothing ugly and manipulative about it. Because people do need this validation as recognition; they are hungry for it and you are giving it to them. And that also gives you the power to influence them and move them in the direction that you want.

### Everybody Crave Influence Or Power

A lot of people might think this is manipulative.

But everybody craves influence or power in some certain way. There is a certain group of us, maybe the majority that thinks that that may be wrong somehow. And then there is a small number of people that think, "I'm gonna do that, I deserve to have that." And unfortunately I think a lot of people that will use this stuff responsibly are in the bucket of folks that say it's wrong to want to be able to influence people and to get under their defenses.

It is absurd for people to think they don't want that. They are not been honest with themselves.

You wanna go through life unable to influence your children? To have no effect on them?

You wanna go through life not been able to influence your boss and get them to give you a raise, and get them to recognize your incredibly good work?

You wanna go around not been able to influence your colleagues or people that you want to date?

You f**cking want influence! You should stop been dishonest to yourself.

Everything you do influences somebody, negatively or positively. People are reading you day in and day out like a book. They are reading your moods: your emotions. And they are saying, "I like you", "I don't like you." You are influencing them without realizing you are doing it because we respond to people in non verbal ways. So whether you want to or not, you are influencing people. You might just be putting them off; that's your influence.

So first of all it is happening, you are just not in control of it. Second of all you are not been honest with yourself.

Do you want a child that you can't tell them what to do? That you can't mold to some degree? You can't get rid of their ugly habits?

You have a spouse that who has a terrible habit to ignore you all the time, you don't want the ability to somehow get them to change?

Give me a break. I really can't stand that level of dishonesty that people have. You want the power to influence people. It is an incredibly deep human need. Just stop lying to yourself and admit it, then you can use it for positive purposes.

### Takeaway

*If you need a favor, don't remind people of what you've done for them in the past, remind them of what they've done for you in the past. And that re-enforces their generosity. So you've fed their self opinion about themselves and that makes it more easier for them to help you and that is extremely powerful.*
