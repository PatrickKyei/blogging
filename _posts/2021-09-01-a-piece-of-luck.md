## Perspectives

People  have distinctive methods of parsing events and I won't quarrel with anyone's view on that.

There's a great deal of conversation around luck, both in the political sphere, in the business sphere, in the economic sphere, you can truly isolate those things. Just as far as we could tell.

We're only sort of terrible as people in assessing what is attributable to luck.

> What luck even is? We're not really sure a lot of the time.

The number of times when we've been affected by luck is countless. Furthermore, it's not my highlight attempt to recommend that I'm more perceptive than others, that I notice these things and the vast majority don't. It's simply that in the event that you get hit over the head hard enough by luck, you will see that.

## Scenarios

Someone wins the lottery, we say that individual was truly lucky.
The man who gets ready for his all time interview, gets ready early but gets stuck in the middle of the road due to a car breakdown and misses his interview, I will say he was very unlucky.

So we noticed vivid examples like that yet when luck plays out as it typically does throughout everyday life, it's in far more subtle ways, and we tend not to see it's significance in those cases. We see successful people, 30 years into their careers, almost all of them are hardworking and talented. There are a few examples to the contrary.

You can think of lip-syncing kid groups or different people who have succeeded without much hard work or talent, but most of the people who make it big really do work hard. They really are talented. And then it comes time to look back and try to explain to themselves, why did I succeed? You know, that's what we do as people we construct narratives about our lives.

And we do so from the things that are most accessible in memory. So if you've been successful, you've probably gotten up every day and worked hard. You can recollect endless instances of doing that, even occasions when you didn't feel like it, which is when you're most likely to remember examples. You can remember all the hard problems you solved because you solved so many of them over those years. You remember all the formidable opponents that you had to vanquish along your path to the top.

*So there are simply regular inclinations in human perception to remember the obvious causes of events that we see and to disregard things that don't occur oftentimes or as strikingly.*

If you had to battle against an obstacle you're hyper-aware of that, you remember it, you include it in your story. If you had a wind at your back, that's something that you just don't notice. And so I think in complete innocence, will in generally think back on their lives and say, "Goodness, I did it all myself."

If you succeeded, it wasn't just because of things you had done yourself but community had a hand in it too. And part of the social contract is to pay forward. So that the next group that comes along will have its shot at success.

And it really depends on how you raise the subject in the first place. How people will react to it?

If you tell people that they were lucky to be in a certain environment, they blow up. What I found out, and this was very coincidentally, was that if you take a slightly different approach, if you say to a successful friend, *"Would you be able to think about any instances of best of luck you enjoyed along your way to the top?"* You don't get an angry or defensive reaction if you just ask that question. People think about it, their eyes light up when they can think of an example of good luck that they have.

They want to tell you about it. And in the act of telling you about it, that kindles a memory of another example of luck that they enjoyed. And then they're telling you about three or four, and then suddenly they're engaged in a conversation.

So you've got to be careful not to appear to be saying, "Oh, you're successful. You don't deserve that,"-because that's not the message.

## How  to Increase your Chances of Been Lucky

What about the network effect? How does that exacerbate the effect of luck?

> The number of chances you have to get lucky when things aren’t going your way is through your network.

The things we do often are more important to us if more other people are doing the same things we're doing. So you want to read a book? What book would it be advisable to pursue? You could say, "I simply need to read the best book and that is all I care about." But another thing you probably care about in addition to reading the best book is to have an opportunity to discuss the book you read with other people. And you can't do that if you read a book that no one else reads.

And so if you have two books of equivalent quality, you will get a similar advantage from pursuing one as the other, except if one has a more grounded readership. One's on the best seller list and the other one isn't. Then in addition to getting the same enjoyment you would have from reading the other book, you're going to also enjoy more opportunities to discuss that book with friends who will have read it as well. So when that's true, the saying, **"Success breeds success," holds with a vengeance.**

## The Acknowledgement Effect

You know, this is always so interesting. I do see a ton of successful people who just don't even understand or just flat out refuse to acknowledge the role that luck has in their success. And for me, I'm constantly trying nowadays to count my blessings. Where was I lucky? Of course there's gratitude involved, right? I'm so lucky that this happened. I'm so lucky I was born in this generation, for example. I'm so lucky that I got great people around me and that I didn't screw up my life.

I haven't been hit by a bus lately or ever for that matter now. But the idea here is also that when we count the role of luck in our lives, it helps us get a little bit more compassionate for those that don't have it. Not that it's an excuse for other people or anything like that, but at least we're not measuring people by the same measuring stick that we have when we're counting our luck, or I should say discounting our own luck.

And there's a lot here that I think breeds compassion. It breeds a realistic viewpoint of what is possible in our own lives, especially given the amount of luck that you have just by virtue of reading this and understanding English and reading it on your super expensive by most standards in the world, mobile device, using 4G that your country has for you. I mean, there's endless amounts of things to consider lucky in our lives.
