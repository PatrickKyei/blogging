## Perspectives

People have distinctive methods of parsing events, and I won't quarrel with anyone's view on that.

There's a great deal of conversation around luck, both in the political, business, and economic spheres; you can genuinely isolate those things just as far as we can tell.

We are just awful as people to evaluate the attributes of luck.

> What luck even is? We're not really sure a lot of the time.

There are countless times when we have had luck. In addition, it's not my highlight to recommend that I am more aware of these things than others and that the vast majority are not. It's just that if you get hit hard enough by luck over your head, you'll see.

## Scenarios

When someone wins the lottery, we say that person was indeed lucky.
I will say that the man who gets ready for his all-time interview, gets prepared early, but gets stuck in the middle of the road due to a car breakdown and misses his interview, was very unlucky.

We saw vivid examples like that, but when luck acts in the way it usually does in everyday life, it does so in far more subtle ways, and we tend to overlook its significance in those cases. We see successful people who have been in their careers for 30 years, and almost all of them are hardworking and talented. There are a few instances where this is not the case.

So, if you've been successful, you've most likely worked hard every day, right?
You can recall a plethora of instances of doing so, even when you didn't feel like it, which is when you're most likely to recall examples. Because you solved so many difficult problems during those years, you can recall all of them. You recall all of the formidable foes you had to overcome on your way to the top.

*So there are simply regular inclinations in human perception to remember the obvious causes of events that we see and to disregard things that don't occur oftentimes or as strikingly.*

If you had to battle against an obstacle you're hyper-aware of that, you remember it, you include it in your story. If you had a wind at your back, that's something that you just don't notice. And so I think in complete innocence, will in generally think back on their lives and say, "Goodness, I did it all myself."

If you were successful, it wasn't just because of your own efforts; the community also played a role. And paying it forward is part of the social contract. So that the next group that comes along has a chance at success.

And it all comes down to how you bring up the subject in the first place. How will people react to it?

People become enraged when they are told that they are fortunate to be in a particular environment. What I discovered, by chance, was that if you take a slightly different approach, if you ask a successful friend, *"Would you be able to think about any instances of best of luck you enjoyed along your way to the top?"* If you simply ask that question, you will not elicit an angry or defensive response. When people think about it, their eyes light up when they recall an instance of good luck.

They'd like to tell you all about it. And the act of telling you about it jogs their memory of another instance of good luck. Then they're telling you about three or four, and then they're having a conversation.

So be cautious not to appear to be saying, "Oh, you've had a lot of success. You do not deserve it, "-because that's not the point.

## How  to Increase your Chances of Been Lucky

What about the network effect? How does that exacerbate the effect of luck?

> The number of chances you have to get lucky when things arenâ€™t going your way is through your network.

The things we do are often more important to us if more people are doing the same things we are. So you want to read a book? What book should I read? "I just want to read the best book," you could say. But, aside from reading the best book, you probably want to be able to discuss it with other people. And you can't do that if you read a book that no one else reads.

So, if you have two books of equal quality, pursuing one will give you a similar advantage as pursuing the other, unless one has a more grounded readership. One is a best-seller, while the other isn't. Then, in addition to getting the same enjoyment from reading the other book, you'll have more opportunities to discuss it with friends who will have also read it. When that is true, the adage **"success breeds success" holds true with vengeance.**

## The Acknowledgement Effect

You know, this is always fascinating. I see a lot of successful people who don't understand or refuse to acknowledge the role that luck plays in their success. And I'm constantly trying to count my blessings these days. Where have I been lucky? Isn't there a sense of gratitude involved? I consider myself extremely fortunate that this occurred. For example, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have been born in this generation. I'm so grateful that I have wonderful people in my life and that I haven't messed up my life. I haven't been hit by a bus in a long time, if ever.

> However, the idea here is that counting the role of luck in our lives helps us become a little more compassionate for those who do not have it. Not that it's an excuse for other people or anything, but at least we're not using the same measuring stick when we're counting our luck, or should I say discounting our own luck.

And there's a lot here that I believe fosters compassion. It fosters a realistic vision of what is possible in our own lives, especially considering the amount of luck that you have just by virtue of reading this and understanding English and reading it on your highly expensive by most standards in the world, mobile gadget, utilizing 4G that your country has for you.

**I mean, there's endless amounts of things to consider lucky in our lives.**
