> **4** Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. **5** It does not dishnor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. **6** Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. **7** It always protects, always trust, always hopes, always perseveres.

Love comes with a lot of promises. You go into it hearing many promises and giving a lot of promises of your own without knowing exactly what to expect in return. So yeah, from the onset, you start giving something without knowing what to get in return.

What are your beliefs, principles, values in a relationship? You go in compromising and losing a lot of them. Maybe that's how it's designed to be? I can't really tell.

## You Lose everything in Love

Most people believe the notion that **"falling in love"**Â is a beautiful package full of everything they've ever wanted: companionship, passion, friendship, and so on. The truth is that a relationship is an empty box at first. Before you can take something out, you must first put something in. There is no love in relationships.


People have love within them. And in a relationship, people place a high value of love into it. In a relationship, there's no romance. It's up to you to instill it in your relationship. A pair must learn and practice the art of providing, loving, supporting, and complimenting in order to keep the box full. The box will be empty if you take more than you put in.

So I come back to the main point:

> Love is a losing game, we only learn to become better losers.

## How do we become better losers?

Yes, it is just as it sounds; become better losers. Since we've gotten to know we don't enter into a love relationship expecting to gain everything but rather losing ourselves the question is; how much of ourselves can we lose?

One cannot keep pouring from an empty cup. You eventually become dry and weary. In every relationship you must have a sense of when you are losing too much of yourself. A point where you have to make an awakening call to your partner to invest in the relationship. 

You have to know when even too much can become unhealthy for your relationship. Just like how the sea can have an overflow and destroy valuable things, one person receiving too much of everything in a relationship can be toxic. Your partner may become callous, 


<!-- I remember travelling into London with my mum and brother when I was about 14 or 15 years old. When we got into London, not far from islington/highbury area, the traffic was slow but flowing with a stop start rhythm. As we were gradually edging towards the front of a queue that was caused by a set of traffic lights, a beautiful girl that was sitting and waiting at a bus stop to the left of me caught my eye. I couldn't help but stare at her as she sat there and gaze towards the sky, in her own world. Looking at her I could see that her carefree head was in the clouds just watching the day go past.

She then turned her head and noticed me staring at her, we made eye contact. As we paused in that brief but beautiful moment, eyes locked looking at one another, we shared a beautiful subtle smile before breaking into a full on contagious beaming smile, as if we were good friends sharing a private joke and all the passersby were none the wiser.

 I thought "wow look how beautiful she is and what a gorgeous smile" and then blushingly I turned my gaze away, not wanting to make it awkward for myself nor her.

Then I thought to myself "Hold on! Was that?!"

I snapped my neck back and realised, Yes! it was indeed Amy Winehouse! She started laughing realising that I had processed, computed and only just clocked on.

I exclaimed to my brother "look!! that's Amy Winehouse there!"  He was more focused on the road and the lights up ahead as they began to change green he didnt believe me anyway.  

As the car started moving I quickly put my windows down and shouted "AMY!!" She looked and was laughing even harder and then I knew without doubt it was her.

The cars moved off and my moment with her had passed.

I still think of that moment, especially when I go into London, as I usually go past the exact same spot. I think what if I would have got out the car and just took my shot at striking a conversation with her. Just to connect with another human and interact before going on about our days and lives.

She had a beautiful smile. And I can still picture her in that moment. -->
