Broken people hurt people.

Their words and actions wound

And cut deep to the core

They cause you to question who you are.
They cast a shadow of fear and doubt within your heart

They give rise to an ocean of underlying emotions.
And they give birth to a sea of insecurities within you
If you allow them to

But you may learn to appreciate

That hurt people hurt people

Because they are in need of healing

And are projecting their hurt, pain and insecurities onto you

And you may choose

Not to grant them any permission

To disturb your joy

Disrupt your wellbeing Or distract you from your growth

You may refuse to allow their words

To be a reflection of your worth

And allow your healing
To be greater than their unresolved pain and trauma

Allow your compassion
To be greater than their cruelty

Allow your self-love  
To be greater than their hate

Allow your confidence  
To be greater than their insecurities

And understand  
That their words hold no power over you

When you appreciate  
That they are a reflection of them  
Not you

And while hurt people hurt people  
They don't have to hurt you

If you refuse to allow them to.
