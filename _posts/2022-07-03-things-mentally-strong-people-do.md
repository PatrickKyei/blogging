Everyone who wants to live a happy life should put a strong emphasis on maintaining a healthy mind. 

We must learn to place a higher value on our **time**, **health**, **sincere relationships**, and **clarity of mind**. 

Because the worth of these things tends to increase with age.

But how can one keep a strong mind in this day and age of warfare, economic hardship, and disappointment?

For a mentally strong person:

## They choose to be happy

A mentally strong person is aware that they cannot control other people's behavior or every circumstance. Since happiness is the only aspect of life that can be controlled, they constantly opt to be happy.

In any circumstance I cannot control, one of the things I tell myself is, "It doesn't matter." And yes, if it doesn't matter, it can't control you. My spirit and mind eventually understand and remain peaceful.

## They are not people pleasers

They are aware of when to prioritize themselves over others. When someone crosses their line, they are not scared to say no.

We can't possibly win everyone over, that much is true. However, we may make an effort to live in harmony with the people we love and care about. And sometimes that means saying no certain things.

## The one who reflects often on or at the end of the day

Even someone with a powerful mind can make mistakes. 

Perhaps a while back they made some stupid decisions. It's possible that they harbor jealousies or sentiments of inadequacy for another person. 

The fact that people take the time to consider their actions and feelings is what matters. One can pinpoint the core problem and approach it with real solutions by engaging in self-reflection.

## They tackle the difficult tasks first

One cannot be in a constant state of ignorance forever. Eventually, all these tasks will catch up to you, so address them quickly!

They deal with issues that must be dealt with at hand. They don't postpone important issues because they are hard. And because of that they are well built for hard times.

## They listen to their bodies

A strong mind comes from a healthy body.

People with strong mental abilities are aware of what they put into their bodies.

They frequently go to the gym or do aerobic workouts at home. They exercise outdoors by jogging, walking their dog around the neighborhood, and they immerse themselve in nature.
