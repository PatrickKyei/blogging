After leaving work, I would typically complete a few courses to stay current before settling down, deciding what to eat, and then going to sleep.

Today was different. I turned off my computer and dropped the lid. I went back and forth between the thoughts that had just crossed my mind as I was getting ready for the day.

Today while I was getting ready for the day, the thoughts of regret was racing through my head. I didn't think much about it because I still had a few things to do before getting ready for work.

But judging by the fact that I was still thinking about it as I settled down to work, it appears that I didn't truly let that concept entirely leave my mind. I considered a few of my own regrets and the causes that led to them.

After giving this some thought, I made the decision to move the entire conversation to the evening.

After work, I made the decision to give that idea some attention and then spend the remaining time before going to bed to it.

Our regrets frequently come from a place of fear and ego, and I think that many people will be able to relate to this. We sometimes miss excellent opportunities because of **fear**, **surprise**, and the **shock** that follows the decisions we must make. Later, we regret not making that choice.

Our own ego also comes between us and great opportunities in life. You rejected that job offer because you think you have completed the university and therefore your CV does not deserve that position whereas you could have hanged on that job, build on your experience whiles you look for better opportunities. But you reject that offer, stay home and cry over unemployment?

You want this but act like you don't need it and then you lose and regret it.

So maybe you might even be overqualified for the job but you'd be rejected and that would be a surprise to you. Yet, apply to next one.

You might be the one who is right and yet still your apology would not be considered. That would be a big shock to you. Nevertheless don't stop trying to fix any broken communication or relationship. Surprise is always better than regret. So many people here with us today but somehow they all keep disappearing. And one day we wouldn't have the chance to have those good times with them. We'd wish we fixed what was broken before they left us.

> Regret is more painful than surprise. That is why the dead receive more flowers than the living.
