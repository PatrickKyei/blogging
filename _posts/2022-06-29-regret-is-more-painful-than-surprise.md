Normally I would read a few courses after I'd close from work to stay up to date before settling down and decide what to eat and then sleep.

Today was different. I shut my pc off, turn down the lid. I shuffled through the thoughts that flashed through my mind when I started my day.

Earlier today as I went about my morning routine, the thoughts of regrets rushed through my mind. I didn't give much of a thougt to it because I still needed to finish up with a couple of things and get ready for work.

But from all indications that thought didn't really leave my mind completely because when I settled down at work I was still thinking about what causes regret in people's lives. I was thinking about some of my own regrets and their contributing factor. 

I gave this some few thoughts and decided to shift the whole conversation to the end of the day.

I decided to entertain that thought and commit the rest of the time I had left to it before I went to sleep.

I hope many will identify with this but a lot of the time our regrets come from a place of fear and ego. Sometimes fear, surprise, and the shock after the decisions we have to make cause us to miss great opportunities and later we regret not making that decision.

Our own ego also comes between us and great opportunities in life. Maybe you just had to say sorry to fix what was broken. But because of ego you miss out on the chance of building something beautiful with someone dear in your life.

There are times that we just needed to go for what we wanted. Fear has stopped many of us from getting what we want out of life. You liked that person or something about them, but fear of rejection has always but you in a corner where you can't have what you have.

Very often it's hard, it's painful and heartbreaking when we have to grieve about the regrets we bore because of fear and ego.

So after thinking about these things one thing that struck well for me. 

“What is the worst that can happen?”I believe that if we can ask ourselves this question and answer it honestly in tough times, we can often come to a better conclusion that will help us avoid too many regrets.

Yes, so you might qualify very well for the job but be turned down. That will be a shock but better than dealing with the regret of not applying and missing out on a great opportunity.

The friend who you are trying to reconcile with can avoid you and say no in many ways. After many years of you been together. That can be a surprise. 

It is better to face that surprise than deal with the regret of their demise and how you could've worked things out together.

> What is the worst that can happen? Because regret is more painful than surprise.

Let's deal with the little surprises today. Those are the ones we can handle best.
