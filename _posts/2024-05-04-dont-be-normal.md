When you are growing up everybody tells you to be normal.

From the moment you were born, society molds you into cookie-cutter versions of itself. "Be normal." "Don't rock the boat. Don't stand out. Just blend in."

Society imposes on you how you should live your life.

You are programmed to follow order, avoid risk and live a 'normal' life

From basic school you are given orders to dress a certain way.  
Stand in queue in a strict order.  
Religion pushes down on you its own indoctrination and ideologies.

For a long time, you have not been your own man.

Normal is overrated. Normal sounds safe, but it's also boring as heck.  
Normal is just another word for mediocre.

You have been sold into a certain way of living life:

Go to school  
Get a job  
Retire at 60  
Have enough money to survive and die

You are programmed to accept someone else's perspective as your truth.

Without conscious thinking, you live a life you have no decision in.   
You live your life on autopilot.

Like a robot on an assembly line.   
Just doing only what you have been programmed to do.

Boredom is a struggle for me. At certain points in my life I decide to pursue new things.

I realized that life becomes meaningful when I am solving a problem that requires my attention, focus and skill.

Every problem I solve becomes a meaningful opportunity to collect valuable information to share with the world.

This is how to become a vessel for value.

The main lesson that I've pulled from all of my life experience and studies is that you should simply do what you love with a conscious mind.

[For those who love to do more with your life](https://skillembassy.org):

 - pursue your curiosity  
 - set your own goals  
 - self-experiment  
 - self-improve  
 - self-educate

Extraordinary efforts yield extraordinary results.

The biggest superpower you have is the ability to observe; the more observant you are, the better your chances of winning in life.

Observe to see that a mediocre life isn't a fulfilling one.

If you want to make something of yourself,  
If you want to leave a mark on this world,   
You have to break free from the shackles of normalcy.

That means taking risks.   
That means embracing uncertainty.   
That means being willing to fail, and fail spectacularly if need be.

If you want to achieve greatness, you've got to be willing to put in the work.  
Be willing to go above and beyond what's expected of you.

Pay attention to the world around you.  
Notice the opportunities that others overlook.  
Be curious, be adventurous, be bold.

It's not enough to just go through the motions of life, to settle for the status quo.

Aim high and dream big.  
Defy expectations and carve out your own path.

### HOW TO LIVE AN EXTRAORDINARY LIFE

#### 1. Learn and Build stuff.

Educate yourself. 

When a question about a certain topic pops up, google
it. 

Watch Youtube tutorials and documentaries.

When something sparks your interest,  
read about it. Read read read. 

Study, learn, stimulate your brain. 

Don't just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours.

Skills not learnt in school are the source of income not found in employment.

#### 2. Make tiny improvements

You can't go to level 10 with level 1 habits.

- Read one page a day.
- Write one page a day.
- Workout for 30mins. 

Then focus on getting 1% better every day. 
Minor improvements over time lead to big changes.

#### 3. Control your actions.

You don't have to answer and react to everything.  
There are certain things you can't control.  
Reacting to everything around you is a sign of impulsiveness.  
Be proactive, not reactive.

#### 4. Try new things

If you don't try new things, you'll miss out on awesome and fantastic adventures and experiences.

If you don't try new things, you'll never know what you can do.

Do what you do everyday all the time, you will always get what youâ€™ve always gotten.

Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

The person who risks nothing does nothing, has nothing, is nothing, and becomes nothing.  
He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love and live fully.
