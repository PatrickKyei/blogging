This is the pattern I have observed.  

 - born into the world.
 - parents/family imbibe in you beliefs.
 - your worldview is shaped by these beliefs.
 - you pass these beliefs around when you grow up.
 - they become the foundations of truths of your life.
 - you pass them down to the next generation of young ones.
 - the cycle continues .

Society has a pattern of doing things and many people go by this pattern. 

It is not difficult to know where you will end up by studying a few people on the same path you choose.

Society is a behavior system. You need to be intentional about the choices and habits you build to reprogram your life otherwise you'll end up like every average person created by society.

By	the	time you	become	 an adult,	you	rarely	notice	the	belief systems	 that are running	your life.

> “Until	you make	the	unconscious	conscious,  
it will	direct	your	life 	and	you	will call	it	fate.” - atomic habits 

Most people never give a second thought to	the fact that	they tie	their self worth to a career path set out for them by society.

Go to school.  
Consume books used to program the masses.  
Get into a defined job doing the same thing for decades.  
Retire at 60 and live a boring life.  
Wait for death. 

After decades of mental  programming, you automatically slip into these systems of bahavior and beliefs.

The brain loves the comfort of doing what it is already used to doing.

You reject anything that is contrary to your worldview.  
Even if it is proven to bring effective results.  
This is the conditioning of society. 

The comfort of the average lifestyle has been sold and bought by many people. 

We dilute the excitement of life by always following the fixed path.  
You need to get lost to find your path.  
Life was never meant to be certain!


## The Internet Has Created New Careers:

The Internet is a blessing to humanity.

A blessing because nowhere else can you find deep knowledge, practical advice, and new opportunities. It is a new decentralized school system because centralized schools survive by training you into the society that funds them.

7 years ago, I had no direction with my life.  
I had 0 influence and 0 career opportunities.  

I used the internet to learn high value skills and built a digital identity.  
I could solve business problems.

My first managerial position came after completing an online course and sharing my accomplishments.  
It brought me a whole world of career opportunities and meaningful relationships.  
I gained the skills to start my online business. 

How?

learn high value skills  
take notes  
build capacity  
build a business or build a small personal project

 - This can be creating a newsletter and sharing what you learn/t.  
 - Sharing your new knowledge on a YouTube channel.  
 - Creating flyers in your college groups about your new design skills.  
 - coding your own portfolio website 


Nothing is more powerful in the digital era.

You are no longer limited to a list of about 50 careers paths.

## Become A Student Again:

To get a different result from everybody it is obvious you need to take a rare path.

It is an unfamiliar path.
Unfamiliar paths create opportunites to learn and build great businesses.

Steve Jobs, Elon Musks, Brian Chesky attribute their success to doing something different from what everybody considers normal. 

Start asking questions.

Any question.

"What courses should I take to start my business?"  
Now you have something to start with.

Find a domain you love:

coding,  
copywriting,  
design,  
marketing,  
sales. 

Focus and commit time to learn in the domain you choose.  
Share your knowledge and ideas on social media to build authority and authenticity.

Solve a problem with the new skills you gain.

Test and validate your idea in the market and observe if there is demand for your business idea.

Build a business around your interest: 

coding, copywriting, design, marketing, sales.

Constantly learn, stay curious, and build.

Continuously iterate and improve on your idea. 


## Focus On Yourself:

Focus on yourself until the focus is on you. 

If you had to be relevant or make a lot of money decades ago, you were limited to being a doctor, accountant, police officer, lawyer, banker etc.

These were dream careers of many people. 

Today, you can literally create your career path by leveraging the internet.

Dedicate time to learn high value skills:
 - graphics design
 - digital marketing 
 - sales
 - programming
 - copywriting
 - etc
Start a business around any of these high value skills. 

People want freedom but never start a business.

People want focus but never remove distractions.

People want to be polymaths but never read books.

People want creativity but never take walks or write.

People want confidence but never lift heavy weights.

People sit on the couch, daydreaming about driving a Lamborghini or walking on the beach with an impressive physique, only to find themselves seeking dopamine hits without taking any real action.

Don’t just wish for change. Go out and create it. - thejordanpreh 

For now you could say I have a boring life.

No weekend clubbing.
No dates.
No TV's

I notice a huge decrease in my mental health when I stop taking action. 

Sitting around, watching Netflix, not working towards anything

It destroys me

I get so unmotivated, so anxious, so down on myself

I'm telling you

Meaningful work is the key to happiness and fulfillment

Nothing is more powerful in the internet age.

Now, it’s my mission to help others create their dream lives and become magnets for life-changing opportunities through learning and building online businesses. 

Learn a high impact skill, build a business and expand your impact. 

Join my dedicated community [(Skillembassy, https://nas.io/skillembassy)](https://nas.io/skillembassy) of smart people where I teach more about how you can:

- learn a high impact skill in 6 months,  
- leverage social media to build an audience,  
- craft a value offer & convert your audience to customers.  
- build a one person business with any high impact skill. 

Here's how i use my time:

- morning: building  
- afternoon: learning  
- evening: connecting & resting 

Learn as you build.

Because if you aren't building you aren't learning.

Apply the knowledge you gain to build a business. 

Solve a problem sitting in your mind with the new information, otherwise you are simply stacking useless knowledge to your as-soon-as-to-beforgotten-brain.

It is dumb to have a million dollar dream and let someone with a 100k salary talk you out of your goals.

Do not shrink your ambitions to make other people feel comfortable around you. Excuse yourself from such environment. 

Go pitch your tent with folks who dream big, talk big and do big.

Society won't respect you because you did what they expected from you. 

People respect you once you do your own thing and go way beyond what they thought you could achieve, at which point, you will also realize that you no longer really care about their validation.
