Google has a graveyard of failed projects.

Some of these projects cost them, tens of millions of dollars and eventually got shut down e.g. Google+, Google Print or Google Hangouts. There are a total of 167 projects in Google's cemetery.

We often forget a crucial point in entrepreneurship: **There is no guarantee of success; regardless of funds, top notch team and access to market**. 

If the most innovative Company in the world can experience failure, it is quite possible for us to create projects from time to time that fail.

The biggest lesson for me is that if something is not working beyond a certain point, it’s essential to accept failure and **Pivot**. Also, it’s essential to wear the badge of our failure with pride and not hide it as an embarrassment.

In Business, Failure doesn't make us a loser, as long as we choose ‘to **Pivot**’ rather than ‘to **Quit**’.
