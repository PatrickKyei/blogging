## The Dirty Mix-Up

![mix-up](/assets/img/mix-up.jpg)

When people say, "Don't forget where you came from," they often misinterpret it. I'll never forget where I came from, but I'm going to fight and do everything I can to avoid going back there. So it's not that I'm forgetting where I'm from; it's that I don't want to be there. I know where I'm from, and that shit was awful. You're not interested in being there.

## Not You, Me?

Everyone says that when I get some money, I'm going to move my family out of the hood. So you don't want to be there, and you don't want your mama to be there, and I'm supposed to make sure I stay? No! I didn't want to be there, you don't want to be there now, and I'm fine with never being able to go back there. And I'm not going to forget it. I respect it, and everything that happens within it makes sense to me. However, going back is not my goal. It's my goal to leave, and it's everyone else's goal to leave.

Shifting your values, healthy pruning away old patterns and self, forming new patterns and new identity are all stages of growth that everyone goes through. There's a lot of good stuff going on there, a lot of development on the side of the high achiever mindset. I'd go find out what that growth is, and then seek out higher-quality influences who will help you get much further in life.
