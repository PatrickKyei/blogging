Pain makes you very alert  
Pain makes you very compassionate  
and pain makes you sensitive to other's pains too.

Pain makes you immense, huge, big.  
The heart grows because of pain.  
It is beautiful, it has its own beauty.  

I am not saying seek pain;  
I am only saying whenever it is there, enjoy that too.

It is a gift of existence  
And there must be a hidden treasure in it.  
Enjoy that too, don't reject it.
Accept it, welcome it and be with it.  

In the beginning it will be difficult, arduous.  
But by and by you will learn the taste of it.  

The taste has to be learned - it is just like other tastes  
When you start anything new  
And of course the taste of pain is bitter.  
But once you have learned it,  
It gives such sharpness and brilliance to you.

You have to learn the taste.  
It shakes all dust, all stupor and sleepiness away from you.  
It makes you more fully mindful that anything else.  
In pain you can be more meditative than in pleasure.

Whatsoever existence gives you  
Try to find a way to use it in such a way that it becomes a creative growth situation for you.
