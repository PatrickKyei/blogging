Every man's life is influenced by change. We can't live without it. It ensures that our lives are renewed and grown by replacing everything old, unproductive, unhelpful, stagnant, or weak with something new. It's what keeps us moving forward.

Accepting the change agent and embracing the process required for our transformation is all that is expected of us. Even though this is the case, it is not easy to achieve. Change can be a difficult thing to deal with. This is because, in order to give us something better, it occasionally takes away something we hold dear or valuable.

As a result, many people are unable to change. Because they are unwilling to change, they are unable to change.

They are **still** the same all the time.
They are what we call **"Still People"**.

Our lives can be negatively impacted by walking among still people. That's because they'll go to any length to persuade you not to make any changes that will benefit your life. They'll rub their fear of change all over you.

One of the best things you can do is to **stay away from them**.

These are some of the remaining behaviors that will assist you in identifying these people:

## Still Complaining

> Complaints won't change the outcome.

Life is full of challenges. They resemble a life staircase. You must be willing to climb them if you want to move higher.

Some people are unwilling to face these difficulties, but they do expect their lives to change. When things aren't going well for them, they will whine rather instead of addressing the issue and seeking solutions.

They grumbled yesterday, they moaned today, and they will complain again tomorrow. If you ask them what they are doing to solve the problem, they will be unable to provide any relevant information. They will instead engage in blame games.

They are always blaming something or someone for their issues. And the irony is that instead of asking help, they will remain at the same place and expect things to change.

## Still Broke

> If you are not willing to work for it, then don't complain about not having it.

Money isn't everything, as the saying goes, and this may be true in some cases. However, we cannot deny that money solves 95% of our problems in our world. Money is required for almost everything. We need money to properly understand what it means to be comfortable in life.

Anyone in your life who constantly complains about how broke they are yet does nothing to improve their condition would be be hard to deal with.

One of the advantages of friendship or any other type of personal relationship is that the other person will be able to help us when we are in need. We don't think about it, but it's something we anticipate.

Anyone who relies on you all of the time because they claim they are financially broke will eventually feel entitled to your resources. This is particularly toxic to any relationship.

> Being broke is not a dollar amount. It's your lack of ambition and vision.

## Still Hating

Hate is a strong emotion that should be treated with caution. It can restore order and calm if handled carefully. Anyone who comes out to tell you that they don't like what you're doing is assisting you in making positive adjustments in your life.

The same feeling, if fueled continuously against you, can wreak trouble in your life. Someone who continues to despise your life despite your greatest efforts to overcome your flaws will cost you your happiness.

Nobody is perfect. People you don't need to spend your life with are those who can't forgive you for your faults and constantly remind you of them or use them against you.

## Still Nowhere

I'm sure your dreams and ambitions have changed since you were younger. You now have adult ambitions.

It's not the same where you used to be. And that's because you're continuously making decisions and taking measures to go to your desired destination.

However, other people have fully abandoned their lives. They appear to be lifeless inside. No matter how hard you try to inspire them, they have no hope for the future.

> Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too. - Mark Twain

Mediocore is not a title, but rather a label for anyone who refuses to improve; it is your responsibility to ensure that you do not wear this badge.

Don't remain **STILL**. Always strive to grow, see a brighter future, rejoice in the achievement of others, and be a better version of yourself.
