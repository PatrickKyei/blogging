Every man's life is influenced by change. We can't live without it. It ensures that our lives are renewed and grown by replacing everything old, unproductive, unhelpful, stagnant, or weak with something new. It's what keeps us moving forward.

Accepting the change agent and embracing the process required for our transformation is all that is expected of us. Even though this is the case, it is not easy to achieve. Change can be a difficult thing to deal with. This is because, in order to give us something better, it occasionally takes away something we hold dear or valuable.

As a result, many people are unable to change. Because they are unwilling to change, they are unable to change.

They are **still** the same all the time. 
They are what we call **"Still People"**.

Our lives can be negatively impacted by walking among still people. That's because they'll go to any length to persuade you not to make any changes that will benefit your life. They'll rub their fear of change all over you.

One of the best things you can do is to **stay away from them**.

These are some of the still behaviors that will help you identify these type of people:

## Still Complaining

> Complains won't change the outcome.

Challenges in life are inevitable. They are like staircase of life. If you want to go higher you must be willing to climb them. 

Some people are not willing to deal with these challenges but expect change in their life. When things are not going on well for them instead of identifying the problem and looking out for ways to fix it, they will complain.

Yesterday they complained, today they are complaining and tomorrow they will complain again. If you ask them about what they are doing to alleviate the problem, they are not going to be able to tell anything useful. Instead they will play blame games. 

Always blaming their problems on something or someone. And the funny part they will not look out for help but instead stay there and expect things to change. 

## Still Broke

> If you are not willing to work for it, then don't complain about not having it.

It is said that money isn't everything, which may be true in certain situations. But we can't argue out that in this our world money solves 95% of our problems. We need money for virtually everything. If we can truly know what comfort means in life, we need money. 

Any person in your life who always complains they are still broke but doesn't do anything about their situation would be hard to deal with.

One of the benefits of friendship or any kind of intimate relationship is that the other person would be able to come through for us in times of our need. This is not something we think about, but we expect it.

Any person in your life who depends on you all the time because they complain they are still broke would at point feel a sense of entitlement to your resources. This is very dangerous for any kind of relationship.

> Being broke is not a dollar amount. It's your lack of ambition and vision.


## Still Hating

Hate is a powerful feeling that should be handled with care. If handled with care it can restore order and calm. Anybody who doesn't like something you are doing and comes forward to let you know is helping you make positive changes in your life. 



## Still Nowhere

I am certain the dreams and aspirations you had when you were younger might have probably changed. You probably have adult aspirations now. 

Where you used to be isn't the same as today. And that it because you are constantly making decisions and taking steps that will see that you get to where you want to be.

But there are certain people who 



> Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too. - Mark Twain

Mediocore is not a title, rather a designation for anyone who fails to get better, your job is to ensure that you do not carry such emblem.
