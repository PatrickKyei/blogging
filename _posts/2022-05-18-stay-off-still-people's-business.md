Every man's life is influenced by change. We can't live without it. It ensures that our lives are renewed and grown by replacing everything old, unproductive, unhelpful, stagnant, or weak with something new. It's what keeps us moving forward.

Accepting the change agent and embracing the process required for our transformation is all that is expected of us. Even though this is the case, it is not easy to achieve. Change can be a difficult thing to deal with. This is because, in order to give us something better, it occasionally takes away something we hold dear or valuable.

As a result, many people are unable to change. Because they are unwilling to change, they are unable to change.

They are **still** the same all the time. 
They are what we call **"Still People"**.

Our lives can be negatively impacted by walking among still people. That's because they'll go to any length to persuade you not to make any changes that will benefit your life. They'll rub their fear of change all over you.

One of the best things you can do is to **stay away from them**.

These are some of the remaining behaviors that will assist you in identifying these people:

## Still Complaining

> Complains won't change the outcome.

Life is full of challenges. They resemble a life staircase. You must be willing to climb them if you want to move higher.

Some people are unwilling to face these difficulties, but they do expect their lives to change. When things aren't going well for them, they will whine rather instead of addressing the issue and seeking solutions.

They grumbled yesterday, they moaned today, and they will complain again tomorrow. If you ask them what they are doing to solve the problem, they will be unable to provide any relevant information. They will instead engage in blame games.

They are always blaming something or someone for their issues. And the irony is that instead of asking help, they will remain at the same place and expect things to change.

## Still Broke

> If you are not willing to work for it, then don't complain about not having it.

Money isn't everything, as the saying goes, and this may be true in some cases. However, we cannot deny that money solves 95% of our problems in our world. Money is required for almost everything. We need money to properly understand what it means to be comfortable in life.

Anyone in your life who constantly complains about how broke they are yet does nothing to improve their condition would be be hard to deal with.

One of the advantages of friendship or any other type of personal relationship is that the other person will be able to help us when we are in need. We don't think about it, but it's something we anticipate.

Anyone who relies on you all of the time because they claim they are financially broke will eventually feel entitled to your resources. This is particularly toxic to any relationship.

> Being broke is not a dollar amount. It's your lack of ambition and vision.


## Still Hating

Hate is a powerful feeling that should be handled with care. If handled with care it can restore order and calm. Anybody who doesn't like something you are doing and comes forward to let you know is helping you make positive changes in your life. 



## Still Nowhere

I am certain the dreams and aspirations you had when you were younger might have probably changed. You have adult aspirations now. 

Where you used to be isn't the same as today. And that it because you are constantly making decisions and taking steps that will see that you get to where you want to be.

But there are certain people who have completely given up in life. It is like they are dead within. 



> Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will do that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too. - Mark Twain

Mediocore is not a title, rather a designation for anyone who fails to get better, your job is to ensure that you do not carry such emblem.
