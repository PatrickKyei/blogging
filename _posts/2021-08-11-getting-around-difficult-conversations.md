## Networking

Meeting new people in your life is exciting and illuminating.  We are all made of exciting and unique traits that can be shared and learned. Forming new bonds starts with a warm touch in the form of a conversation. But many people find this as a deal-breaker that is often not overcome. Well, if they try, the result they expect don't go the same. You may have remembered a day you mastered the courage to start a conversation with a stranger you liked but immediately got bounced. It's sad and can demotivate you 5x. But we still need to foster healthy relationships with other people.

One may ask why it's even necessary when people try to push you back all the time. We cannot make up for a lost time when it comes to relationships and networking. So we need to start building and maintaining relationships right from the go.

## Getting Past The Rejection

What are some methods to use when people  shut you down aggressively in a conversation?

If people in a conversation are giving you one-word answers, they are often shy and less skilled in conversation or more because they don't like you or possibly because they are not in the mood to talk. You can figure out which one is it by asking an open-ended question that is not a yes or no question. If you do this and they give you the shortest answer possible, disengage; they don't want to talk for some reason. There's no point in figuring out why. If they don't like you, who cares. It's not relevant most of the time. If they don't wanna talk, fine, not really your problem. Obviously, if this is family, friend, or work colleague, you might wanna investigate another time; not at the moment, that's just annoying. But if it's a stranger, just cut bait and move on. Zero-point trying to get blood from a stone. If they are just shy, asking open-ended questions will help them open up and keep the conversation going.

## Use Question Statement Strategy

Instead of asking questions, use the question-answer statement formula. Instead of asking a question and getting an answer and asking another question, which just starts to feel like an interrogation - you ask the question, get the answer, then make a statement that relates to that question before asking another question. This makes things more conversational.

For example, the usual way people have conversation is like this:

Questions: Hey where are you from?

Answer: Kumasi.

Question: What do you do there?

Answer: I'm a teacher.

Question: How long have you been teaching?

Answer: 5 years.

Now the question statement formula turns that into this:

Question: Where are you from?

Answer: Kumasi.

Statement: Oh wow my parents grew up there actually. Is your whole family still out there?

Answer: Yes they are.

Question: What do you do out there?

Answer: I'm a teacher.

Statement: My mum is a teacher in Kumasi too. What district? What subject do you teach?

So you end up with a statement in between the next question. It's different because you are both sharing information both ways even if the other person isn't  asking you anything. So there's more of a share, and the conversation tends to get deeper and more rapport gets generated because of this.

It's a great way to get someone who isn't a great conversationalist more at ease and get them to open up a bit more. And do so earlier on the conversation

## It Starts With Practice

A lot of the difficult things in our life are made easier with practice. None of us was born ready-made for anything. We learn by doing, and by doing, we become better. These are actionable drills that can help you get past difficult conversations and engaging in exciting chats.

Go out there and put this to the test. You will be amazed!
