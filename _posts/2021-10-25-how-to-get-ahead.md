> You must first decide what kind of life you want to develop and eventually live, and then design a strategy around that life.

We simply express the experiences, whether they were the finest or not because life can be a wonderful battle, dude. Let's just have fun with this. Make the best of it.

And now I'll go right to the point. I want to win, and I want to win big. Not only should you win, but you should win large.

## What Is The State Of Your Ambition?

Without a doubt you don't have the same ambition that you had when you were younger. Obviously you have adult ambition now. You're not just like galavanting up the streets or whatever. It's a completely different and more ambitious game.

## Honor The Process

The process is what makes you able to enjoy and manage success. The example I thought of is like, without the process, you're like that lottery winner who's like, "Oh, I have $10 million now." And then in two, three, five years, they're broke.

Success is determined by what you do when no one is watching, and it is built one brick at a time. That is perhaps one of the most crucial and underappreciated pieces of advice that I believe many individuals who are trying to make it don't consider.

Many people are doing everything in front of the camera, and when the camera is turned off, there's a lot of, ""Well, I'm done now that I've uploaded it," or "I'm done now that the video is out." I'm finished now."

## The Value Of Time

> Time is a luxury you cannot afford

You have to take advantage of your time. Time is the most valuable asset you will ever have control of. So you have to take advantage of it right now.

How do you decide which habits or activities or people that you need to cut out? Because not everything is going to be aimed towards your goals. Like sometimes you just have friends, but I assume you've got a rule of thumb for this kind of thing.

Because just a few things will be significant in three years. You may be dealing with a lot of fluff right now - it's fluff. And would you say, "I'm a great admirer of fluff?" That's nonsense. We're not even going to remember them. We won't remember the names of those who never actually gave value to our lives.

## Stand On The Shoulders Of Giants

> Continue to invest in your abilities and connections because they are what will rescue you. Start putting things together in a way that allows you to pursue your job. If you put in the effort, you can always carve your own route in life.

Networking with leaders and individuals who have gone before you in your career is not meaningless; what you should learn is "how do I master the art of networking, how do I master the skill of meeting wonderful people in the sector I want to enter and use it for my career? Because, to be honest, there is no virtue in sitting about and doing nothing. It makes you no more ethical than anyone else. It certainly does not increase your chances of success. I'd prefer you take up your paddle and row your boat of life, deciding whether or not you want to live the life you so desperately desire. Decide on it and go for it.

## Cultivate A Beginner Mindset

> People that are intelligent listen a lot, but they also change their minds a lot.

Never believe you have everything figured out. Maintain a beginner's attitude at all times. You've just created a ceiling for yourself the moment you believe you've discovered a lane and have it all figured out.
Oh man, and you'll get better and better. And then you'll be surprised in three months how your life has changed. You'll be surprised.

## Have A Balanced Life Life

It's great to get things done perfectly.

But you don't want to be overly efficient since that would make your life regulated. And I believe that creativity comes from a different source. It stems from when everything is a jumble and you have to make sense of it, symbolically, physically, and aesthetically, and then you innovate with a solution. For that reason, I believe a balanced life is underrated.
