_Grudge_

Holding grudges can be a heavy burden to carry, both emotionally and mentally. It can consume one's thoughts and emotions, leaving little room for positive experiences and growth.  

Moreover, when we hold onto grudges, it can prevent us from being able to move forward and have healthy relationships with the people around us.

It is also important to remember that people's lives are indeed short, and it is a precious commodity we can never get back. Holding grudges can prevent us from living in the present moment and enjoying the time we have with others. 
Life is too short to waste on negative emotions and regrets. Instead, we should strive to let go of grudges and focus on living in the moment and fostering positive relationships with those around us.

Additionally, holding grudges can be a futile endeavor because often people's actions that hurt us are not personal. 

People's behavior is the outcome of the combination of their experiences, the way they were brought up, their current state of mind, and the environment they live in. 

Thus, it can be insightful to consider that the actions that caused you harm may not be a reflection of the person's true intentions, and therefore it could be unnecessary to hold a grudge.

All in all, I always keep in mind that holding grudges does not benefit anyone, especially not ourselves. Life is short and fragile, and it is important that we make the most of the time we have by letting go of negative emotions and fostering positive relationships.
