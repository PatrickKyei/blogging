Maybe you've not even thought about what the internet is, how it came about or how you are able to send an email to a family member or make a Whatsapp call to a friend. The interesting thing is, many years ago you couldn't do any of these. Wih the power of the Internet now you are able to do so many amazing things.

### So what is the internet?

Most people have little clue how the internet came about. Different people have different opinions about what the internet is about and a lot of the time people get it wrong, well probably they don't need to be right or wrong. Because the average user just cares the internet works for them. There are many things in our lives that we don't really think a lot about how they came to be but use them anyway. Like the pen you use for writng, the zip on your cloth, the fan in your room - we don't even know who their inventors are. The same thing is often said about the internet.

Many years ago, the internet was started as a project by two people **[Vint Cerf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vint_Cerf)** and **[Bob Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Kahn)** that resulted in what we have as the internet today.

### Why should we even care about this?

Well it happens that the internet brought with it many other advantages that if we know and put it to use could help us solve many problems around us and also make us a fortune.

One of the biggest problems the internet came to solve is the communication problem. Somewhere a 1000 years ago, you couldn't take a phone to have a video call with anyone or think of sending an email or a photo on Whatsapp to anyone.

Now with the power of the internet we can keep in touch with our loved ones who are far away from us, we can pioneer the technology of autonomous vehicles, we can pull information about the weather in seconds and many more.

The internet has made people like Bill Gates, Mark Zuggerberg, Jeff Bezoz and many other like them billonaires. How?
