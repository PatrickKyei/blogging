## Take daring steps in the direction of your intuition

It'll feel uncomfortable at first, but it'll be so worth it in the end.

Daring to do something you've always wanted to do brings a new form of energy into your life and awaken your happiness. It removes boredom and the feeling of sameness which makes life dull.

## Drop the "I'm an introvert" label and talk to people you find interesting

In the end we ONLY REGRET THE CHANCES WE DIDN'T TAKE and the RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE AFRAID TO HAVE.

> Everbody needs somebody in the end.

Move towards people that reflect who you want to be and how you want to feel.

## Respond to negative situations instead of reacting

When something negative happens, don't **react**; instead, plan a concrete action step to improve the situation.

Making bad decisions during bad situations can make you feel uneasy. In any uncomfortable situation, don't rush in the heat of the moment to make decisions that will make you feel worse later.

If it possible, take your time, consult a second opinion to ensure your decisions are quality. Because quality decisions leads to a happier life.

And that reminds me of the lessons I learnt from a [life experience](https://patrickkyei.com/posts/mistakes-that-cost-me-my-sunshine)

## Accept failure as a part of the process in anything you undertake in life. It isn't a letdown in any way

Understand that as you are figuring things out and making decisions about your life you are likely to make some bad ones. Which is fine. It's part of life process.

Learn from them and use them as a guide to make better decisions can lead you to your success.

## Have a goal to strive for â€“ gain that delayed satisfaction for deliberate practice

Don't always expect to get the results you need to day. If you have to make some sacrifices to gain something greater tomorrow do it.

Be broake for a while, save some money and invest it, work on your relationship and enjoy it, take time to look after your health and reap the benefits.

## Don't waste your time focusing on negative information

You cannot control someone's negative behavior but you can control how you react to it. Good things happen when you distance yourself from negativity.

## Remove people from your life who sap your energy

You are not compelled to do anything or anyone that is targeted at your energy. You can still be a nice person whiles you do it from a distance.

## Treat yourself with respect

Treat yourself with respect and others will learn to do same.

Make yourself a priority once in a while. It's not selfish. It's necessary.

## Be yourself - Get rid of the pressure to please others

Learning to achieve this will take time, but it will be well worth the effort. Whatever you are just be a good one.

## Never stop doing things that make you uncomfortable

With one easy step outside of your comfort zone, your success story can begin right now.

Make it a habit to be innovative and daring.
