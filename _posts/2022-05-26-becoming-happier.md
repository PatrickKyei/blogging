## Take daring steps in the direction of your intuition

It'll feel uncomfortable at first, but it'll be so worth it in the end.

Daring to do something you've always wanted to do brings a new form of energy into your life and awaken your happiness. It removes boredom and the feeling of sameness which makes life dull.

## Drop the "I'm an introvert" label and talk to people you find interesting

In the end we ONLY REGRET THE CHANCES WE DIDN'T TAKE and the RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE AFRAID TO HAVE.

> Everbody needs somebody in the end.

Move towards people that reflect who you want to be and how you want to feel.

## Respond to negative situations instead of reacting

When something negative happens, don't **react**; instead, plan a concrete action step to improve the situation.

Making bad decisions during bad situations can make you feel uneasy. In any uncomfortable situation, don't rush in the heat of the moment to make decisions that will make you feel worse later.

If at all feasible, take your time and get a second opinion to ensure that your choices are sound. Because making good judgments results in a happier life.

And that reminds me of the lessons I learnt from a [life experience](https://patrickkyei.com/posts/mistakes-that-cost-me-my-sunshine)

## Accept failure as a part of the process in anything you undertake in life. It isn't a letdown in any way

Recognize that while you're figuring things out and making life decisions, you're bound to make some mistakes. That's OK. It's a natural part of life.

You can learn from them and use them as a guide to make better decisions, which will help you achieve your goals.

## Have a goal to strive for â€“ gain that delayed satisfaction for deliberate practice

Expecting to receive the outcomes you require now is not always realistic. If you must make some sacrifices in order to get something greater tomorrow, do so.

Be broke for a while, save some money, and invest it; work on your relationship and enjoy it; and take time to care for your health and reap the rewards.

## Don't waste your time focusing on negative information

You have no influence over people who spread negative news, but you do have control over how you react to it. When you keep your distance from negativity, good things happen.

## Remove people from your life who sap your energy

You are not obligated to do or stay with somebody who is attempting to drain your energy. Even if you're doing it from a distance, you can still be a kind person.

## Treat yourself with respect

Many will learn to respect you if you treat yourself well.

Once once a while, put yourself first. It isn't a case of being self-centered. It is necessary.

## Be yourself - Get rid of the pressure to please others

Learning to achieve this will take time, but it will be well worth the effort. Whatever you are just be a good one.

## Never stop doing things that make you uncomfortable

With one easy step outside of your comfort zone, your success story can begin right now.

Make it a habit to be innovative and daring.
