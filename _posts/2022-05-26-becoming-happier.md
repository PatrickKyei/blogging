- Take daring steps in the direction of your intuition - it'll feel uncomfortable at first, but it'll be so worth it in the end. 

Daring to do something you've always wanted to do brings a new a energy into your life and awaken your happiness. It removes boredom and the feeling of sameness which makes life dull.


- Drop the "I'm an introvert" label and talk to people you find interesting.

IN THE END, WE ONLY REGRET THE CHANCES WE DIDN'T TAKE and the RELATIONSHIPS WE WERE AFRAID TO HAVE. We are social animals and sometimes we need someone to share those happy moments with. 

Move towards people that reflect who you want to be and how you want to feel.


- When something negative happens, don't **react**; instead, plan a concrete action step to improve the situation.

Making bad decisions during bad situations can make you feel uneasy. In any uncomfortable situation, don't rush in the heat of the moment to make decisions that will make you feel worse later. 

If it possible, take your time, consult a second opinion to ensure your decisions are quality. Because quality decisions leads to a happier life.


- Accept failure as a part of the process in anything you undertake in life. It isn't a letdown in any way.

- Have a goal to strive for – gain that delayed satisfaction for deliberate practice.

- Don't waste your time focusing on negative information.

- Remove people from your life who sap your energy; you are not compelled to do anything.

- Treat yourself with respect —

- Be yourself - Get rid of the pressure to please others. It will take a while.

- Never stop doing things that make you uncomfortable - make it a habit to be creative.
