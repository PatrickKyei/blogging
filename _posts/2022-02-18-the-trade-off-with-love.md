> Love is a broad and delicate subject that is contested all around the world. Many of us have tasted its bitter or sweet side in one way or another.

Life throws us into a lot of unexpected situations, and we occasionally have to deal with things we weren't expecting.

One example is suddenly having to end a relationship with someone you adored and held so dear. It's difficult and hurtful at times. You may feel as if you've lost everything and that the world is collapsing around you. Physical pain accounts for the pain and scars that love leaves.

It's not very helpful when someone you care about asks you to sacrifice a lot in order to be with them or stay together. It's not always them; sometimes it's just the way things are.

It is especially painful and feels like a burden when it put upon you to make this big decision.

When you are compelled to make this major decision, it is very unpleasant and burdensome.

Have you ever loved someone so much that it feels like you two know everything there is to know about each other, that you can understand each other even in silence, but you can't be together or see each other because of religious differences, career opportunities, education, tribe, group status, or simply because of some principles, and one of you has to give up on these things?

Oh, man, this is a difficult one. In either case, there are some important trade-offs to be made; there is no such thing as a free lunch. This, I believe, is what makes life so intense.

There is rarely a single clear road that leads to all you desire. You're continually making decisions that require you to give something up. But the nice thing about these roadblocks is that they give you an opportunity to check in with yourself and figure out what you actually want.

So, obviously, I'm not in a position to tell you what to do. We can only think about how to make this decision. And you make this decision by sitting down for a few hours, going for a stroll or a run, or going somewhere else where you can be alone with yourself, and weighing your two possibilities. What are the advantages and disadvantages? What are the things that are most important to you?

Is it your devotion to your relationship, job, or other endeavors and their fulfillment, or is it your current relationship?

And I don't just mean what matters most to you because that can be tricky. Your brain could keep you stuck because the brain wants everything. It's terrible with trade-offs and it can argue both sides of a decision till the cows come home.

What brings you the most joy in life? Which job would motivate you to get out of bed in the morning? What kind of growth do you wish to achieve? What kind of community would you like to join? Is it your faith or your relationship that gives you the most satisfaction? Those are also vital questions. To be honest, it's probably more significant than the practicals and logistics.

Another thing I would recommend is determining which parts of this equation are genuinely fixed and which are flexible or might be made flexible.

Could she be happy in Colorado if you guys talked it out and treated it like an adventure? Could you guys commit to taking a trip to another state every couple of months so she doesn't feel so isolated?

Do you work in this role for a few years and then negotiate going remotes to the cheek and then go to DC and you can support her career goals? All of these things are possible if you open up the aperture a little bit.

So take some time to clarify your priorities, but also look for ways to manage the circumstance to your advantage as much as possible.

Life is rarely as fixed as we believe it to be; there are always hidden chances, unexpected rewards, and multiple interpretations of events, and you will never be able to perceive them all at once.

You may have to take a leap of faith, but if you stay aware, put in the effort to be outstanding at what you do, and cultivate meaningful relationships with others, they will almost always present themselves. That's what I've noticed.

Having said that, it is conceivable that you may have to give up one or two items as a result of this decision. I understand, but that's life. If you truly want this career and your girlfriend doesn't fit into your plans, you might have to part ways for a time and maybe you'll find your way back to each other, or maybe you won't and you meet a lady in Colorado who wants to run 5ks with you every Sunday and that's your road.

I'm not sure, guy, life may be chaotic, but whatever you do, take this as an opportunity to reconnect with yourself. What do you desire? Who do you want to spend it with? What do you care about? Speak with others you trust to acquire further opinions. Communicate with your partner. You can't go wrong if you follow what thrills you beyond money, prestige, and practicalities. So good luck, man, it's not an easy decision.
