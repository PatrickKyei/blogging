Project managers oversee projects from inception to end and act as guides for their teams, relying on their exceptional organizational and interpersonal skills at all times.

According to Google, students who have completed a training or course Google Career Certificate in project management in the United States have reported a 75% improvement in their career trajectory.

I made the decision to embark on a 6-month intensive learning journey on Project Management.

I finished the course after 13 weeks of hard effort and perseverance. I struggled with depression on several occasions but never gave up. Upon the many challenges that I faced - light offs, procastination, slow internet connectivity, and many more, I am happy to pronounce a successful completion of the tranining.
