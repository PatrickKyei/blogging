As I’ve grown older  
Less of the things that once mattered to me  
Now matter.

I’ve come to appreciate  
That those who anger me control me  
And so I no longer give them permission to disturb my joy    
Or disrupt my wellbeing  
And am more readily able to let go of what once triggered, burdened and upset me  
In order to preserve my peace.

As I’ve grown older  
The list of things I desire for my life  
Has slowly dwindled  
To include less physical things  
And more of the intangible:  
Joy, comfort, fulfilment, purpose and love.  

As I’ve grown older  
I am now discovering  
That my worth is not defined by or tied to  
My attractiveness or appeal to the opposite gender  
My external physical beauty  
Or the amount of money I make and possessions I own  
But is better reflected through  
My capacity to show up fully in the world  
Be my loving, authentic self  
And live kindly, purposefully and meaningfully.  

As I've grown older  
I’ve come to appreciate  
That while I once feared  
Being ignored and overlooked  

I now embrace the freedom I feel  
To spend my free time as I wish  
To do, act and say whatever I please  
Without feeling the need to impress or please others  
And to live my life in a way  
That is fulfilling and satisfying to me  

And it has taught me  
How little other people’s judgements and opinions truly matter  
When you are pursuing what brings you joy  
And living in alignment with your purpose, goals and dreams.  

And as I’ve grown older  
I have come to appreciate that ageing is a precious gift  
As it means that I have experienced the fullness, depth and richness of life  

And I have come to understand what a glorious and magnificent adventure it can truly be.
