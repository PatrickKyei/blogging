Society promises you sweet-nothings.

Society will tell you that you can be anything that you dream of.

Then set a strict path for you in your teens.

What happened to “you can become anything you dream of”

They will make you feel like your dreams are unrealistic.

5 years ago I thought about giving up my dreams. 

I had big dreams. I had a picture of the path I wanted to take.

When I reached my teens society handed me a different plan.

Everybody told me to go to college, find a job, save enough money and retire at 60.

And so most people have the goal of going to college, getting a job and retiring at 60. 

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is.  
And your your life is just to live your life inside the world.

Try not to bash into the walls too much.  
Try to have a nice family life.   
Have fun.   
Save a little of money.  

That's a very limited life.

People are used to the 'linear' approach to things.  
So when attempting something new you have to hit multiple brick walls.

This is the way ideas interact with reality.  
Which is in fact a pretty dense structure of infinite interrelated components.

I always wanted do my own thing. And when I talk about my 'own' thing I mean a personal project - a business.

I was quite early to know that the best way to live a fulfilling life is to work on a project that you can relate and find meaning in.

If you don't work on your own project you will be assigned to work on someone else's project.

I'm just wasting my time at that point. 

Why am I going to continue working on a project if it doesn't give me any meaning? Business is a personal project and every entrepreneur was trying to solve a personal project whether they had the intention to sell the solution or not.

There's no substitute for doing your own work.

While I was doing my 9-5 I was spending 2-4 hours everyday learning.

If you want to get anywhere in life and you lack the skill you have to bridge the gap with self education and personal experience.

To get anywhere in life you have to work extremely hard and you have to be disciplined.

If you wanted to be a great piano player there's no drug you can take.  
There's no self-help book.

You got to spend 5 years, 10 years learning it until it becomes something of second nature. 

Then you can play chords you could never play before.   
And that's the paradigm for everything meaningful in life.

There are no shortcuts.


Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

If you learn something well and build business for yourself it can bring you a far greater pleasure than any kind of employment you will do for anybody.

But you have to be patient and you have to not be afraid of boredom and you have to not be afraid of the effort and going off the broad way.

The mind seeks order and society sell it cheap. And so many people have subscribed to the single way of doing something.

By the time you become an adult , you rarely notice that you've been doing the same thing as everyone else. And you are bound to get the same result.

I wanted something different. Something greater than the average life.

Which is what life should be about.  
Living up to our greatest potential. 

When I started out I didn't have all the resources and technology I need to work with.

So if it was as some prefer it and it was all about getting everything ready, then I was doomed. 

Because circumstances changed and I found myself having to navigate life and start my own business.

I took an inventory of all that I didn't have, and all that I did have.

And created opportunities out of what I did have. 

I chose discomfort severally, to work on the things I didn't have. 

I am still playing the long game.  
I'm putting in the work. 

And have met incredible people through networking who are guiding my journey.

It's not about what you have or where you were born.  
It's about what you make with what you have.

I've met so many people who have the urge to build their own thing but have yet to start.

Immerse yourself in learning. Seek knowledge and skills to improve your current self. 

The more time you spend learning
You can tailor things to go your way

It's good to learn from different set of people
But you have to find your own voice also

Do yourself a favor.  
Build and learn along the way.

It's not the easiest way to start a business, but it is the best.  
The rate of feedback cycles from multiple sources a day will be massive.

Iterate based on feedback.  
Stack experience.  
Stack results.  
Win at life.

For the time being, follow your curiosity.  
If you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.

Happy New Month.

Hope this helps. Talk soon!
