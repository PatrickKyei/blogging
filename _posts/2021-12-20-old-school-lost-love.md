## Green Leaf

The fact is that I'm not sure why I like you.

I simply know I love you a lot;

I'm not sure how much I love you;

I just know I will love you for a really long time.

When everything around us is changing and the world appears to be moving too quickly, remember that I'll be right there with you.

So, whether you think about future changes or how the past used to be, remember to glance beside you because that's where you'll find me adoring you with all my heart.

That's one thing you can count on that will never change!!!!

## Into the Valleys

I loved you, and I probably still do,

And for a while, the feeling may remain...

But let my love no longer trouble you,

I do not wish to cause you any pain.

I loved you, and the hopelessness I knew,

The jealousy, the shyness - though in vain -

Made up a love so tender and so true

As may God grant you to be loved again.
