I once ran from fear  
And so it paralysed me  
Unitl I learned to feel it  
And not let it suffocate me  
But rather to allow it to gently flow through me  
So that I may transform it into **passion**, **purpose** and **meaning.**

I once ran from grief  
Until I realised  
It was a treasured visitor  
For it revealed the vast ocean of love  
That lay within me  
And my capacity to feel  
And care for others deeply  

I once ran from rejection  
Until I realised  
That it need not cause me any hurt or harm  
When I was able to fully embrace and accept myself  
And honor my strengths and greatness  
Celebrating the beauty and brilliance that lay within me  

I once ran from hearbreak  
Until I realised  
That my heart was my own  
And the only person who could truly break it  
Was me  
Through disowning myself  
And valuing how another person saw me  
About how I chose to see myself  
And giving them the power to shape  
How I felt about myself and my reality  

I once ran from failure  
Until I realised  
That it was my greatest teacher  
And that pain need not stem from it  
When it empowered me to choose and act better in the future  
And live more compassionately  

I once ran from shame  
Until I learned to befriend it  
Then gently farewell it  
Through granting myself permission to be imperfect  
And make mistakes  
While not letting them define or limit me  

I once ran from guilt  
Until I gave it purpose  
And redirected it toward meaningful action  
Allowing it to propel me along a path of love and healing  

I once ran from negative thoughts  
Until I realised that their origin was my emotions  
And by claiming and uplifting myself  
They would transform accordingly  

I once ran from anger  
Until I realised that it was not to be suppressed or ignored  
But felt fully  
Fuelling me to take passionate action toward what was most meaningful and important to me  

I once ran from discomfort  
Until I realised  
It was one of my greatest guides  
Revealing all that was in need of changing and healing within me  

And I once ran from my shadow  
Until I realised  
That I was the alchemist of my life  
And the power to transmute the darkness into light  
Lay within me.
