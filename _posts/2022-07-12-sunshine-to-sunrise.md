Hey ...

... hey!

There is always something about our day, that no matter how hard the day goes or how strong the party is, the sunset will draw the curtain on all forms of human activities.

That is sometimes to us a room for thought and an opportunity to rest our worn out bodies.

You look out for the sunshine when there's something about the next day you greatly anticipate.

That is how I have looked out for each day. The Sunshine that brings out a new energy to face whatever the day throws at me. You are that sunshine.

You were a great source of my joy. I always looked forward to a new day to see you, talk to you and feel your presence.

But just like how there is a sunshine for each day, there is a sunset for each day. A sunset for us to let go yesterday's pain, replan our steps, rest our stressed bodies and refocus for a new day.

You've always been amazing. I won't trade any of the time that I got to spend with you for anything and I don't regret any of those. People say some sunshines make deserts and some grow forests. You were the sunshine that made things grow young and vibrant.

All the good days and bad days make up a story of one's life. A life that holds a journey to where we are now and a story of days we don't want to forget. And in all of them we remember the smiling days most. What happened to the days we were not smiling? The days we fought hard, felt pain, stumbled and couldn't stand on our feet? We forget them. We work only to make our days of joy permanent. Our days of sorrow we work to forget them.

All the time, it is the things, people and moments that we cherish most that our hands find to make a mess of. Because the things we don't want we don't keep near. So for every pain, tear and heartbreak I caused you, I hope you forgive me genuinely.

Humans are not finished products. All of us are work in progress. We wake up each day and do things that make us better than who we used to be. That's part of why we are alive. To make amends for yesterday's mistakes. The finished product are the ones who die.

Listen to me carefully. I don't have forever to live. I don't have all it takes but I am that guy who loves to try. If I can put smiles on your face, I will try. If I can rekindle your joy and restore peace where there is pain, I will try. If I can put assurance where there is doubt and uncertainty, I will try. I want to be better and I will try.

I look forward to A Brand New Day.

A day with a lot of sunshine and smiles. A day with so much joy in our hearts and laughter in the air.

To A 365 days journey with you **Sunshine**.
