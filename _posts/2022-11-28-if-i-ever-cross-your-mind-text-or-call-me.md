> Remembrance is an act of love.

If someone spares their time to listen to you:

If they find a way to reply to your messages, 

To get your calls, or to remember after you missed them, no matter how long it took,

If they are always positive, cheerful, smiling and happy with and around you without ever or very rarely talking about ther problems and difficulties in life, 

If they are available for you in anyway now or later,

If this person exist in your life, YOU ARE BLESSED.

Take time to cherish that person.

Take time to listen to them. It is the only gesture of gratitude you can do to that person.

Take it upon you to consider it as a center of interest, even for a short period of time.
