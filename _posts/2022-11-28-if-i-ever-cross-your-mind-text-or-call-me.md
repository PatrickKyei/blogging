I cannot remember the number of times I emphasize the need to build and maintain your relationships. 

Yes. So I might end up been the one doing it the most. Maybe reaching out all the time. 

I enjoy doing it and find satisfaction when I have the conviction that my favorite people are doing very well in life. 

But that doesn't cancel the fact that I would wish the same care for myself.

It is a good feeling when you know you are in the good thoughts of another person. And they care about you so much that they go forward to show it. 


> Remembrance is an act of love.

If someone spares their time to listen to you:

If they find a way to reply to your messages, 

To get your calls, or to remember after you missed them, no matter how long it took,

If they are always positive, cheerful, smiling and happy with and around you without ever or very rarely talking about ther problems and difficulties in life, 

If they are available for you in anyway now or later,

If this person exist in your life, YOU ARE BLESSED.

Take time to cherish that person.

Take time to listen to them. It is the only gesture of gratitude you can do to that person.

Take it upon you to consider it as a center of interest, even for a short period of time.
