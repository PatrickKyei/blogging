I cannot remember the number of times I emphasized the need to build and maintain your relationships.

Yes. So I might end up been the one doing it the most. Maybe been the one reaching out most of the time.

I enjoy doing it and find satisfaction when I have the conviction that my favorite people are doing very well in life.

But that doesn't cancel the fact that I would wish the same care for myself.

It is a good feeling when you know you are in the good thoughts of another person. And they care about you so much that they go forward to show it.



> Remembrance is an act of love.

If someone spares their time to listen to you:

If they find a way to reply to your messages,

To get your calls, or to remember after you missed them, no matter how long it took,

If they are always positive, cheerful, smiling and happy with and around you without ever or very rarely talking about their problems and difficulties in life,

If they are available for you in anyway now or later,

If this person exist in your life, YOU ARE BLESSED.

Take time to cherish that person.

Take time to listen to them. It is the only gesture of gratitude you can do to that person.

Take it upon you to consider it as a center of interest, even for a short period of time.

**So if I ever cross your mind, find a thoughtful way of saying hi**

Because remembrance is also an act of love. It is the act of holding someone dear to your heart, even after they are no longer with you. 

> It is the act of keeping their memory with you, of cherishing the time you had together, and of honoring the impact they had on your life.

When we remember someone, we are not just thinking about them in the abstract. We are actively engaging with their memory, reliving the moments we shared, and feeling the emotions that are associated with those memories.

In this way, remembrance is a deeply personal and emotional experience. It connects us to the people we have lost, and it allows us to continue to love them, even after they are no longer together or close to them.

Remembrance is also a way of showing respect and gratitude. It is a way of acknowledging the role that someone played in our lives, and of thanking them for the love and support they provided. By remembering someone, we are honoring their memory, and we are expressing our appreciation for the time we had together.

Remembrance can take many forms. Some people choose to express it in action and some choose to express it in words.  Others may write letters or poems, or create art or music as a way of expressing their love and remembrance. Still others may simply take time to reflect on their memories, and to cherish the time they had together.

Regardless of the form it takes, remembrance is an act of love. It is a way of keeping the memory of our loved ones alive, and of continuing to love and honor them. 

It is a way of expressing our gratitude for the time we had together, and of ensuring that their memory lives on in our hearts.

## So If Someone ever crosses your mind let them know and they will remember to do the same for you.
