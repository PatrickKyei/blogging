> Creativity exists on a spectrum. Some of us are visionaries, some of us are technical masters.

From empty paper, or a blank screen,  
We bring forth thoughts that others might find keen,  
In a spectrum of creativity that knows no bounds.

Sometimes it's hard to find the right words,  
To convey our exact thoughts and emotions,  
But perfection is an impossible goal,  
Chasing it can take its toll,  
Leading us to procrastinate and lose control.

Throughout the years, we're taught to do things well and improve,  
But sometimes we feel like we're failing if we don't,  
Forgetting that progress is not always linear, but something we must always move.

Perfectionism can be a trap,
Creating an impossible standard that's hard to surpass,  
Leading us to procrastinate and lose control.

So I commit myself to crafting with care,  
For I know that by committing my thoughts to paper or screen,  
I can filter, sort, and extract the most useful and keen,  
Improving as I go, with each new iteration,  
Never holding onto outdated ideas, but always learning and growing.



For I know that progress is not linear,  
And it's through this non-linear path that I'll steer,  
Towards the best version of myself, year after year.
