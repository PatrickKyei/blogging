*(June 2021 - January 2023)*

Now this is a solution I created to help bridge shortage of facilitators at the time I was working with a Non-profit organization.

The managers very often had challenges filling in new positions. The solution I came up with helped a lot. It was able to fill 8 positions and got 8 people jobs to do.
