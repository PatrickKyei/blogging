One thing that I remember when I was growing up was that I loved reading.

Not just reading.

I was curious about life. 
I was curious about how certain things work.
I was curious about how people behaved the way they do.

My love for reading was far more beyond leisure. Reading was one way to satisfy my curiosity. 

One of the biggest books I had the opportunity to read at a very young age was one of the Harry Potter series - Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.

It didn't end there. I went on to read bigger books. 

I read different genres of books with deeper insights. I loved reading Adventure fiction, self-help, science fiction and novels.

Reading became my habit. It was the go to option to learn about life, understand how certain things worked and explore human behavior.

5 DRUGS no one talks about: 
 - walking
 - reading
 - writing
 - meditating
 - exercising

They become addictive that once you start, you can't stop.

The best ways humans have understood other humans, society, culture and civilizations is through written down records of those accounts.

A lot of valuable lessons are lost when we don't keep a written account of events for future generations to consume.

It is an invaluable opportunity to see life through the lens of another person who has walked the same path as you. You get the chance to eliminate mistakes and lazer-focus on the proven ways things work.

How to get 10 years ahead in 1 year in your 20's.

Look at what everyone else is doing then do the opposite.

While they consume, create.
While they buy stuff to impress others, invest in your self-education.
While they waste their time on tiktok, spend your time learning.

The 1% opportunities are found where the crowds aren't.

If you understand how the mind works, you understand how schools alone can ruin your life through narrow mindedness and programming.

The greatest threat to an individual's potential is to stop learning after graduation.
Learning is the foundation of the human experience. 

You have two options:
Learn and build a better future for yourself.
Or get distracted by desiring the things that you don't have.

Elon Musk built  the most valued  space compnay  SpaceX, through self-education.

He has mentioned that he learned how to build rockets and electric cars through self-education.

Musk’s reading extends to subjects like physics, engineering, science fiction, and even philosophy. His extensive reading helps him think creatively and approach problems from various angles, contributing to his innovative ideas.

He applied what he learned like a madman. (Well, he started multiple billion-dollar companies in different industries. How's that for applying?)

Elon Musk stated that he read for about 10 hours a day when he was younger. 

Some of the world's richest men like Bill Gates, Warren Buffet, Elon Musk cited reading as a key for their success.

If you’re interested in a particular subject, read books, watch Youtube videos, take courses on related topics to broaden your knowledge and become intellectually curious about the world.

Start with one.

 - YouTube is free.
 - Facebook is Free.
 - Twitter is free.
 - LinkedIn is free. 

Today, technology has the potential to help you become well-informed and an expert on one topic.

Stop mindless scrolling. Be intentional, build an audience. Solve their problem or provide a form of value. If you help enough people get what they want, you get everything you want.

Like Elon Musk once said:

“That’s the single best piece of advice: constantly think about how you could be doing things better and questioning yourself.”

I love science fiction. I’ve reached a point in my life where I enjoy nothing more than sitting on the couch, reading an interesting sci-fi or novel book.

The technology I read about often sends me down a rabbit hole that inspires me to learn about AI, Internet of Things (IOT), and many other tech-related subjects.

For those who love to do your own thing

 - pursue your curiosity
 - set your own goals
 - self-experiment
 - self-improve
 - self-educate

You can take advantage of social media and make it a learning space.

Make use of Twitter, LinkedIn to build yourself and learn a lot of things that will alter your growth and self-development.

A never-changing job isn’t going to bring you fulfillment (but it can be a good stepping stone.)

If you’re a self-starter, self-education via the Internet will get you further than 99% of college degrees.

School isn’t really for education. It’s for socialization. Real learning happens with yourself.Self-education and self-improvement should not be underplayed.

In case you want to stay close, expand your consciousness on crucial topics, leverage on the power the internet offers and build your own thing, you should join my community of Builders, Creators and Side Hustlers using the link [Skillembassy.](https://skillembassy.org)

Re-invent yourself.

Only consume information that educates or inspires you. Learn what you need. Do what you’ve learned. Keep doing it consistently.

You don't like the life you live. You know you need change but you continue to chase cheap dopamine.

6 months of intentional self-education will change your life.

And whatever has to do with transforming your life has a high value so make sure to pay the price when needed.

To those who don't want to end up like everyone else...

To those who don't want their attention stolen from them...

To those who don't want to continue building others' dreams instead of their own...

If you are lost the answer is education.
If you are educated the answer is execution.
If you are executing the answer is consistency.

Even when it doesn't seem like it, there's always the next step forward.

Consider this: 

You're one decision away from a different life.

Ask yourself "What if I'm successful? What if this changes everything?" 

So what's the decision you need to make? 

What do you need to do now?
