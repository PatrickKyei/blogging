"You may not be his/her first, his/her last, or his/her only.

He/She loved before  
He/She may love again.  

But if she loves you now,  
what else matters?  

He's not perfect - you aren't either,  
and the two of you may never be perfect together  
but if he can make you laugh,  
cause you to think twice,  
and admit to being human and making mistakes,  
hold onto him and give him the most you can.  

She may not be thinking about you every second of the day,  
but she will give you a part of her  
that she knows you can break - her heart.  

So don't hurt her,  
don't change her,  
don't analyze and  
don't expect more than she can give.  

Smile when he makes you happy,  
let him know when he makes you mad,  
and miss him when he's not there.  

Love with your whole being when you receive love.  
Because there are no perfect girls, but there will always be a girl/boy who is perfect for you."
