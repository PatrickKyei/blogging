During my childhood days, I would see a lot of leaves fall to the ground in the dry (harmattan) season.

I was curious about why this happened but I didn't really bother to ask anybody. 
I felt it wasn't any serious thing to trouble anyone about.

It was until I grew up that I understood why this happens during one of our science class.

Hold on a little with the plant thing for me.
I will tell you why this question that I ignored years ago was so important and how it changed my life. 

And I believe you can learn from this too.

### Growth comes from letting go

You see during the dry season, plants face water scarcity and high temperatures. To survive these harsh conditions, plants shed their leaves through a process called abscission. 

I am going to plug this process to the human life. As all things of nature share certain commonalities, humans share this process with plants.

Here's what happens during this phase of your life:

### Drawing Parallels Between Plant Adaptation and Human Brain Evolution

Just as plants shed leaves to adapt and survive during the dry season, humans also go through adaptive processes throughout their lives. Here’s how each point about plant adaptation relates to how your mind goes through different changes:

1. **Water Conservation - Resource Management**:
    - **Plants**: Shed leaves to conserve water.
    - **Humans**: Conserve resources (energy, time, focus) to adapt to changing environments. For example, during childhood, the brain prunes unnecessary neural connections to optimize learning and development. This is what makes children learn very quickly about their environment.

2. **Reduced Energy Demand - Efficiency in Growth**:
    - **Plants**: Drop leaves to reduce metabolic demands.
    - **Humans**: Simplify and prioritize tasks during different life stages. In adulthood, people often focus on core responsibilities and skills that matter most for personal and professional growth, shedding extraneous activities.

3. **Protection Against Damage - Psychological Resilience**:
    - **Plants**: Avoid damage and infection by shedding leaves.
    - **Humans**: Develop resilience and coping mechanisms to protect mental health. Over time, individuals learn to manage stress and avoid harmful situations, much like how plants avoid potential leaf damage.

4. **Cycle of Renewal - Lifelong Learning and Adaptation**:
    - **Plants**: Prepare for new growth when conditions improve.
    - **Humans**: Continuously learn and evolve. Throughout life, humans adapt to new experiences, challenges, and knowledge, fostering personal growth and renewal.

Now can  you appreciate the intricate processes that underpin growth and survival in nature and human life.

### Here's where things take a turn

Some humans, unlike plants skip phase 4 of the mental life cycle.

Society conditions you to think a certain way with beliefs and teachings to conform.
This conditioning crystallizes in your brain and becomes part of your identity.

You'd do everything to defend these beliefs if you feel they are threatened.

We saw from the plants that in order for it to stand the chance of survival, it has to let go of some of it's leaves and regrow new once it has passed the phase of the severe drought.

The challenge with some people is that they continue to hold on to their old system of beliefs.
They continue to apply old information to their current life.

Life evolves and you have to evolve with it.

### Adopt a new mental module around business

We are not building businesses like we did in the 2000's.

The first place to build a business in 2024 is online.

> Build distribution, then build whatever you want. – Jack Butcher 

If you will prune away your old mentality and adopt to the modern times, you'd see that starting a business in 2024 is the easiest you can do.

Start as one person. 

Leverage the technology available to you. 

Years ago it wasn't possible to do this but with the internet powering apps and the technology we use you can build anything if you have distribution. 

Write posts every single day that live on your profile. 

Network with people to get them shared ([so you can grow without the algorithm](https://nas.io/skillembassy/)). 

Start a YouTube channel or Instagram live to build authority 

Plug your newsletter so you own your audience. 

Give away free value to grow your audience. 

Sell a low-ticket product to have more people dedicated to your brand. 

With an audience of 10,000, newsletter of 1,000, and network of 100 – you can do anything you want. 

You have the resources to make a full time income at this point. 

Beyond that, you can funnel extra cash into building your dream company or investing.
