Life itself is a battle, at least that's how I can see it. We are on a battlefield against so many things that threatens our survival.

Family matters, work issues, hearbreaks, setbacks in life and many others. As we grow older and become exposed to life, we see more of these coming at us. They get us confused and question so many things about life. 

The thing about the battles we will face in our lives is that they are lifetime. Every stage of our life and the troubles it brings. Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose. And each one is a lesson if we can consider it as so.

Without experience we try to fight all of these battles at once and many times we are so overwhelmed. When we become overwhelmed we break down and tend to give up.

We can prioritize our battles and face them in order of importance so that have the strength for another day. 

Fix the issue with work before you relationships. Fix the problems in your relationship before you consider a family. When we try to do all at once we invite chaos. 

However we can rest and face our battles the next day. On a battlefield sometimes you have to retreat, restrategize and come again even stronger.
