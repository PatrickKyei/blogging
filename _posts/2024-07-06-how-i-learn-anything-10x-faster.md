## Your brain is a problem solving machine.

I like to compare how the brain operates to a computer.

The brain controls all human functions and ensures a smooth running of day to day tasks.

Much of human innovation is inspired by nature and human interactions with the natural world.

From the invention of aeroplanes which are inspired by birds to the inventions of submarines inspired by fishes, many inventions are copied from nature.

Nature learns by doing. 

> Birds learn to fly by flying.
Children learn to walk by walking.
The brain build connections and expands through intensive activities.

Don’t fight with reality, flow with it.

### Let's break this down

I spent part of my life living close to the countryside. This was in my early years growing up.

We used to go bird hunting with other kids in the neighborhood just to explore around.

When we get to the bed nest, we disturb the nest for the mother bird to fly away so that we can catch the younger birds home for our entertainment.

Usually after 4 to 7 days, the little birds would have started to learn how to fly. By day 10 they would have learnt to fly away if you were not careful when you were playing with them.

That simple aspect of the baby birds life often kept me thinking a lot. I always wanted to understand how the bird could learn how to fly without anybody teaching it how to fly and especially when the mother was not with it.

### You need limits to find yourself

Your brain thrives on intensive activities. 

Each problem you solve in your life sparks neural connections. 

Learning isn’t passive activity. It’s an active, dynamic process that builds patterns in your brain through repetition and experience.

Birds don’t sit in a nest reading flight manuals. They leap, flap, and sometimes fail.

All the periods we spent throwing the baby birds up and down playing with them were times they were practicing their flight moves.

The same goes for children learning to walk. They stumble, fall, and get back up, each attempt strengthening their ability.

Learning to walk is a very difficult milestone to cross by children but you are doing it so effortlessly now because your brain has mastered the skill and has solved the walking pattern for you and so you don't consider it as a big task anymore.

What you think you are doing now is putting one foot in front of the other. But it is more complex than you think about it.

The fundamental ingredient for your overall growth is self education. This is the foundation of your growth.

Ask yourself, how did you learn how to walk?
You learn how to walk by taking some few steps, stumbling, falling, getting up and walking again. You learnt how to talk by cooing, bubbling, making ineligible sounds until you learnt to talk.
### Start before you are ready

When you want to learn anything, it is common to want to read about the topic through or watch videos about it throughout.

This actually hurts you. Because for example, if you want to learn design, you'll go to YoutuTube and binge watch videos about the topic before you decide to start. 

After you start you realize that you've forgotten all that you learnt and have to go back and watch again. This is called tutorial hell.

#### Study the principles

I am building a new website. 

I mentioned this in one of the previous Letters, I think in the last two Letters.

Principles are important. I have some background in web design. But I am using a new css frameworks I have not worked with before to build my new website. 

Instead of going to YouTube first to watch videos about how to use the framework, I am going about it in a whole new way.

I am starting with the project, building the website and looking at the documentation, or watching a YouTube tutorial to solve a specific problem I encounter during the project.

You begin to appreciate the depth of what you are learning when you have a project you can apply what you are learning to - building stuff.

If you are thinking about a small project you want to build in real life and apply your experience to then enroll in the [7 Days Value Creator Writing Challenge]([https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/content-writing-challenge](https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/content-writing-challenge)) where you will learn how to: 

1. Start an online business,  
2. Grow your customer base,  
3. Make tons of money in the process.

#### Start before you know how.

Think about it. The best way to learn how to swim isn't by reading every book on swimming technique—you jump into the pool and paddle around until you figure it out. 

The same goes for anything else you want to master. Whether it's starting a business, learning a new skill, or pursuing a passion project, the most effective approach is to dive right in and learn as you go.

Stop complaining about your lack of results.  
Complain about your lack of action.

Stop debating, planning, and putting things on
hold.

 - Write the book  
 - Launch the podcast  
 - Start building online  
 - Start the side hustle  
 - Build an inbound business  
 - Build multiple income streams  
 - Start the company you always wanted  
 - Build your personal brand and become the
go-to in your industry

Stop putting yourself down.  
You don't have to be an expert or have it all
figured out.

It's you vs you.

Fighting against reality—against the natural way of learning—only holds you back. Embrace the process. Dive into action. Make mistakes, learn, and grow. This is how you truly advance.

#### Teach others, help others

The interesting thing about helping others reach the stage that you have reached (whether it’s free or paid), you are forced to [organize the information](https://nas.io/skillembassy) and make connections.

You HAVE to struggle with organizing information (or ordering consciousness) to pass along to others.

The teacher learns more than the student.

This will open up room to reach your next developmental stage faster.

When you have everything you’ve made sense of packaged up and hosted in the digital world — you don’t have to worry about it anymore. You get to build on top of it. Iteration.

By doing this consistently over a 2-3 year span, you will bust through new stages of development, help others get there, and gain a deep satisfaction for life in general.

There are people who are doing way better than you right now.

The shocking thing is that, these people do not know half of what you know, yet they’re doing better than you.

You've been stuck in the loop of trying to become an expert before even taking the first step.

If you consume too much and don't use it to build, your mind gets fat. 

Thanks for reading. Talk soon.

#### What's up

You might read the online version of this Letter from a new website. 

It wouldn't be in it's perfect state. I will continue to iterate and add features. 

I will virtually be building this [website](https://patrickkyei.com) with you guys. 

Check it out and email me what feature you  think I should add next and where I should be making improvements

There are new resources as well. Do check them out.

I started a YouTube version of the Letters but stopped. I am putting resources together to resume. I will send you updates when I resume so that you can watch or listen to this version of the Letters.

Additionally [Skillembassy](https://skillembassy.org) is yet to Launch to the public. However the interview project with industry experts is running. 

Grab a snack and go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@skillembassy_) and watch the latest series.
