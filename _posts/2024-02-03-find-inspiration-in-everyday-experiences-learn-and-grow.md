I had a curious mind growing up.

I asked a lot of questions and I learnt a lot way beyond kids my age.

Apart from that I was drawn to electronic gadgets.

I was the kind of person you would call to fix a broken radio or set the TV channel.

I always wanted to know more. This natural bend towards the desire to know more led me to read more. I loved reading. You would always see me with a reading book or a writing pad. 

Students should be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt.

These are things that come with our childhood life. Every person had that one thing they loved to do or was inherently good at.

This could be singing, drawing, sporting or dancing for you.

Writing was something I enjoyed too. I wanted to be a writer some day.

Most of the time what we want to become in the future is influenced by things we were interested in when we were kids.

Our childhood dreams influence our future career and aspirations. 

Even as young as you were you could answer to what you wanted to become in future.

And then society happens.

At a point in your growth society dictates the life you should live for you.

Many people have given up the dreams of becoming who they wanted to be in future to become something society told them to become.

If you don’t intentionally choose what you want to do, you will become what society says you should become, and then it will strip you off the happiness and the purpose you may have once had.

99% of people are conditioned to follow a default path in life set out by society.

Go to school.   
Be assigned a program you aren't interested in.  
Get a job.  
Spend 8 hours building someone else's dreams and forget about your own.   
Retire at the ripe age of 60.   
When you have no time left and just enough money to survive (not thrive) until death.

If you question nothing and do what you are told to do passed down by society, you will end up not being able to think for yourself.  
And you will blame the system for the mediocre life you end up in.

Learning is the foundation of the human experience.   
And the school system made many people hate it.

> Students should be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to doubt.

You can follow your curiosity into greatness.

Practice music and become an artist.   
Practice writing and become an author.   
Practice sports and become an athlete.   

When you were kid   
You played been a rock star or your favorite athlete or designer.   
No one told you to stop it or called you unrealistic.

Then suddenly you’re in your 20's.   
Go to college for your plan B.   
Forget the dreams you had because society has conditioned you to believe your dreams are risky.

I have embarked on personal learning journeys and they are some of the most rewarding moments in my life.

I learned how to design on my own. Graphic design and Web design.   
I built my first online business when I was in my 20's.   
Made a few 1000 cedis and discontinued the project. 

My first business taught me how to combine skills to build something for people to use.   
I learned how to address a group of people's pain points and create an income out of it whiles providing value.

Most people turn into robots after graduation.   
Their conditioning takes precedence.   
They fuel society with their actions.   
They do nothing with their life because the system keeps them locked into somebody else's life.

You give up the opportunity to travel and sing around the world,   
Give up what you love doing
To sit in traffic.   
Do 8 hours of unfulfilling work.   
Sit in traffic... again.   
Watch TV.   
Pass out.   
Repeat.

This is mindless programming by society.

When your education limits your imagination it's called indoctrination.   
Those who cannot think for themselves are truly lost.  
Education should be a rewarding experience which allows you to   
think,   
imagine,   
question,   
doubt,   
and solve problems.

We all got these big ideas  
One day they’re replaced with fears.  
All these things we say we’ll get to  
Shot down by the reasons not to.

Don’t quit your dreams.  
The Internet has leveraged the playing field.

You can write and sell a book without a publisher   
Make music without a record deal   
Auction your collection without a gallery

Quit the mindless programming   
Learn different skills   
Explore different areas of life and career   
The future belongs to those who learn more skills and combine them in creative ways.

The internet has created a divide in the economy.   
There's the old economy which is made of college and corporations.   
This was the traditional way of doing things but it has a few problems.

First, notice that for most degrees college isn't the best way to gain information quickly.   
In college you have a lecturer that may be the best lecturer in your town or the city that you live in.

On the internet however, you can listen to the best lecturer in the world.   
You can now get the best education quickly and for free using the internet. 

Corporations are so tightly structured.   
You have the top dog, the manager, the second layer of manager and then finally you have the employees.   
This creates a lot of inefficiency. 

Big corporations can get slow and as a result of this the old economy has split. 

Now we have the new economy.   
The new economy gives you unlimited access to online education. 

And instead of corporations we have the creator economy.   
This is a far more efficient system and it's growing rapidly.

Corporations and colleges are dipping and slowing down and getting smaller.   
The new economy is booming.   
The new economy rewards problem solvers, creative thinkers and high performers.

If you have solved a problem in your life,   
And other people also experience that problem, you are more than qualified to help them solve it.

In the digital economy, you don't need a fancy credential or a prestigious college degree. 

Your life experience is your qualification.

Read a book – share what you learn  
Listen to a podcast – share what you learn  
Watch a documentary – share what you learn  
Have a hard conversation – share what you learn  
Build a business - share what you learn

Side note,  if you have the urge for more out of life join our community of creators, builders and side hustlers: nas.io/skillembassy

I've met so many people who have the urge to build their own thing but have yet to start.

If this is you, pls do yourself a favor.

Build and learn along the way.

It's not the easiest way to start a business, but it is the best.  
The rate of feedback cycles from multiple sources a day will be massive.

Iterate based on feedback.  
Stack experience.  
Stack results.  
Win at life.  

It’s your life that you’re making  
Find out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you.   
Take small steps towards it every day,  
Learn and set the larger vision for a time.

For the time being, follow your curiosity.  
If you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.  
It ain’t big enough if it doesn’t scare the hell out of you.

If it makes you nervous it’s probably worth it.

Happy New Month.
