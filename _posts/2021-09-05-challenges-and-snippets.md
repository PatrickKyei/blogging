## CSS

* When elements have a specified position, such as fixed or relative, the CSS offset properties **right**, **left**, **top**, and **bottom** can be used in animation rules to create movement.

```html
<style>
  div {
    height: 40px;
    width: 70%;
    background: black;
    margin: 50px auto;
    border-radius: 5px;
    position: relative;
  }

  #rect {
    animation-name: rainbow;
    animation-duration: 4s;
  }

  @keyframes rainbow {
    0% {
      background-color: blue;
      top: 0px;
      left: 0px;
    }
    50% {
      background-color: green;
      top: 50px;
      left: 25px;
    }
    100% {
      background-color: yellow;
      top: 0px;
      left:-25px;
    }
  }
</style>

<div id="rect"></div>
```

* The opacity of the animated element gradually fades as it reaches the right side of the screen.

In the displayed animation, the round element with the gradient background moves to the right by the 50% mark of the animation per the @keyframes rule.

```html
<style>

  #ball {
    width: 70px;
    height: 70px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    position: fixed;
    left: 20%;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: linear-gradient(
      35deg,
      #ccffff,
      #ffcccc
    );
    animation-name: fade;
    animation-duration: 3s;
  }

  @keyframes fade {
    50% {
      left: 60%;
      opacity: 0.1;
    }
  }

</style>

<div id="ball"></div>
```

* The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example

```html
<style>

  #ball {
    width: 100px;
    height: 100px;
    margin: 50px auto;
    position: relative;
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: linear-gradient(
      35deg,
      #ccffff,
      #ffcccc
    );
    animation-name: bounce;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }

  @keyframes bounce{
    0% {
      top: 0px;
    }
    50% {
      top: 249px;
      width: 130px;
      height: 70px;
    }
    100% {
      top: 0px;
    }
  }
</style>
<div id="ball"></div>
```

* You can change the animation rates for two similarly animated elements by altering their @keyframes rules. You can achieve the same goal by manipulating the animation-duration of multiple elements.

In the animation running in the code editor, there are three stars in the sky that twinkle at the same rate on a continuous loop. To make them twinkle at different rates, you can set the animation-duration property to different values for each element.

```html
<style>
  .stars {
    background-color: white;
    height: 30px;
    width: 30px;
    border-radius: 50%;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }

  .star-1 {
    margin-top: 15%;
    margin-left: 60%;
    animation-duration: 1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  .star-2 {
    margin-top: 25%;
    margin-left: 25%;
    animation-duration: 0.9s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  .star-3 {
    margin-top: 10%;
    margin-left: 50%;
    animation-duration: 1.1s;
    animation-name: twinkle;
  }

  @keyframes twinkle {
    20% {
      transform: scale(0.5);
      opacity: 0.5;
    }
  }

  #back {
    position: fixed;
    padding: 0;
    margin: 0;
    top: 0;
    left: 0;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    background: linear-gradient(black, #000099, #66c2ff, #ffcccc, #ffeee6);
  }
</style>

<div id="back"></div>
<div class="star-1 stars"></div>
<div class="star-2 stars"></div>
<div class="star-3 stars"></div>

```

* In CSS animations, the animation-timing-function property controls how quickly an animated element changes over the duration of the animation. If the animation is a car moving from point A to point B in a given time (your animation-duration), the animation-timing-function says how the car accelerates and decelerates over the course of the drive.

There are a number of predefined keywords available for popular options. For example, the default value is ease, which starts slow, speeds up in the middle, and then slows down again in the end. Other options include ease-out, which is quick in the beginning then slows down, ease-in, which is slow in the beginning, then speeds up at the end, or linear, which applies a constant animation speed throughout.

```html
<style>

  .balls {
    border-radius: 50%;
    background: linear-gradient(
      35deg,
      #ccffff,
      #ffcccc
    );
    position: fixed;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    margin-top: 50px;
    animation-name: bounce;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }
  #ball1 {
    left:27%;
animation-timing-function: linear;
  }
  #ball2 {
    left:56%;
animation-timing-function: ease-out;

  }

  @keyframes bounce {
    0% {
      top: 0px;
    }
    100% {
      top: 249px;
    }
  }

</style>

<div class="balls" id="ball1"></div>
<div class="balls" id="ball2"></div>
```

* Use a Bezier Curve to Move a GraphicPassed
A previous challenge discussed the ease-out keyword that describes an animation change that speeds up first and then slows down at the end of the animation. On the right, the difference between the ease-out keyword (for the blue element) and linear keyword (for the red element) is demonstrated. Similar animation progressions to the ease-out keyword can be achieved by using a custom cubic Bezier curve function.

In general, changing the p1 and p2 anchor points drives the creation of different Bezier curves, which controls how the animation progresses through time. Here's an example of a Bezier curve using values to mimic the ease-out style:

Remember that all cubic-bezier functions start with p0 at (0, 0) and end with p3 at (1, 1). In this example, the curve moves faster through the Y-axis (starts at 0, goes to p1 y value of 0, then goes to p2 y value of 1) than it moves through the X-axis (0 to start, then 0 for p1, up to 0.58 for p2). As a result, the change in the animated element progresses faster than the time of the animation for that segment. Towards the end of the curve, the relationship between the change in x and y values reverses - the y value moves from 1 to 1 (no change), and the x values move from 0.58 to 1, making the animation changes progress slower compared to the animation duration.

```html
<style>
  .balls{
    border-radius: 50%;
    position: fixed;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    margin-top: 50px;
    animation-name: bounce;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }
  #red {
    background: red;
    left: 27%;
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0, 0, 0.58, 1);
  }
  #blue {
    background: blue;
    left: 56%;
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
  @keyframes bounce {
    0% {
      top: 0px;
    }
    100% {
      top: 249px;
    }
  }
</style>
<div class="balls" id= "red"></div>
<div class="balls" id= "blue"></div>
```

* Make Motion More Natural Using a Bezier CurvePassed

This challenge animates an element to replicate the movement of a ball being juggled. Prior challenges covered the linear and ease-out cubic Bezier curves, however neither depicts the juggling movement accurately. You need to customize a Bezier curve for this.

The animation-timing-function automatically loops at every keyframe when the animation-iteration-count is set to infinite. Since there is a keyframe rule set in the middle of the animation duration (at 50%), it results in two identical animation progressions at the upward and downward movement of the ball.

The following cubic Bezier curve simulates a juggling movement:

```html
cubic-bezier(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.6);
```

Notice that the value of y2 is larger than 1. Although the cubic Bezier curve is mapped on a 1 by 1 coordinate system, and it can only accept x values from 0 to 1, the y value can be set to numbers larger than one. This results in a bouncing movement that is ideal for simulating the juggling ball.

```html
<style>
  .balls {
    border-radius: 50%;
    position: fixed;
    width: 50px;
    height: 50px;
    top: 60%;
    animation-name: jump;
    animation-duration: 2s;
    animation-iteration-count: infinite;
  }
  #red {
    background: red;
    left: 25%;
    animation-timing-function: linear;
  }
  #blue {
    background: blue;
    left: 50%;
    animation-timing-function: ease-out;
  }
  #green {
    background: green;
    left: 75%;
    animation-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.311, 0.441, 0.444, 1.649);
  }

  @keyframes jump {
    50% {
      top: 10%;
    }
  }
</style>
<div class="balls" id="red"></div>
<div class="balls" id="blue"></div>
<div class="balls" id="green"></div>
```
