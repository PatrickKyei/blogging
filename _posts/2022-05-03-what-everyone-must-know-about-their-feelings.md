**What is your relationship with your feelings?**

Do you try to hide or suppress how you feel because you've been told many times that your emotions make you weak? Or you are shamed about them? Or, as a man, you've probably been told that your emotions make you less of a man because admitting your emotions makes you a weak person?

Well I'm here to tell you quite the opposite.

I've learned how to express my emotions correctly, and I've realized that the way I feel is simply a way for my body to communicate with me. As a result, I don't have to be embarrassed or afraid to admit that I am sad, angry, confused, or miss someone. I have quite understood that our feelings or emotions are what make us human.

It is what it is. It's neither good nor bad; it's just a feeling. And we get to decide what to make of it, what to do with it exactly, plus stuffing your emotions all the time takes a lot of energy. It's exhausting, and you're probably exhausted from all of the suppression.

*So what am I saying?*

Recognizing and exploring this stuff with someone you trust is going to be much easier than spending a lot of energy suppressing it. It may be frightening, but it will be liberating, and it will open up a whole new world for you, as well as save you a lot of time spent on hiding them.

## Accept The Way You Feel

So you get angry or sad about something, and you interpret it as bad, which means you should suppress that emotion because it's not right. No!

Your emotions are not something that can be fixed. Emotions aren't something you should get rid of. In fact it's the opposite.

## Explore the basis of the fear and shame

Investigate what you've learned about emotions. Growing up, maybe you were judged for your feelings, maybe you were punished for them, maybe you were blamed for them in some way, or maybe you just grew up in a house where you weren't allowed to have a lot of those feelings.

That will do it as well, or you may have been bullied as a result of them. That will do a number on you, and you learned how to shut down those feelings in order to survive, or perhaps you absorbed some cultural information about how, you know, men are supposed to deal with their feelings; "Just stuff them down and they won't be an issue."

All of these things are common, but they are the early formative experiences that lead to someone not having a relationship with their feelings. That's what I'd look into.

## Your Feelings Are Messages To You

These feelings you're trying to avoid aren't as bad as you think. I understand how intense they feel, but it's the judgment, the self-loving that is causing so much more suffering than just the baseline feelings. So, if you're looking for relief in this situation, you really only have one choice. **Start Feeling**

**Your anger?**

It's telling you where you feel powerless. 
**Your anxiety?**

It's telling you that something in your life is off-balance.

**Your fear?**

It's telling you what you care about.

**Your apathy?**

It's telling you where you're overextended and burnt out.

> Your feelings aren't random, they are messengers. And if you want to get anywhere, you need to be able to let them speak to you, and tell you what you really need.

## Learn to understand your emotions instead of suppressing them

The problem with emotions is that the more you try to control them, the more they control you. So, if you're going to work on yourself, you won't do so by suppressing or hiding your feelings; instead, you'll give them more space in your life and close relationships, as well as in some therapy.

You will never be able to get rid of your emotions, but you can change your relationship with them so that you can process them differently and they will no longer control your life in the way that they most likely do right now.

You'll have to start talking, and you'll have to start feeling confident about how you feel. You believe that emotions make you weak, as so many of us do, right? But all they really do is make you human.

> There's only the meaning we ascribe to those feelings. 

And that's a pretty important reminder for you.

Yeah for sure so time to start feeling. I know you don't want to but it's your only option.


## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Don't be shy to express the way you feel to another human.
- Feelings are what makes us human. They are those things that separate us from plants :)
- Others can easily connect with you if you are genuine about your feelings and are able to express them
- Having a conversation about how you feel should not end in an argument
- When you are genuine with people about the way you feel, you are able to know those who genuinely care about you. And those who are trying to use you and then you can stay far away from them.
- People are able to offer real support to you if they can understand how you feel. It is hard for anybody to offer you emotional support when you say you are happy or ok when in fact you are sad.
