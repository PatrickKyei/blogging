What is your relationship with your feelings?

Do you try to hide or suppress the way you feel because you've been told many times that your emotions make you weak? Or shamed about them? Or probably as a man you've been told your emotions make you less of a man because admitting your emotions make you a weak person?

Well I'm here to tell you quite the opposite.

I have learnt to express my feelings in the right way and I have understood that the way I feel is just a way my body communicates to me. Therefore I don't have to be shy or afraid to admit I am sad, angry, confused or miss someone. Your feelings or your emotions make you human.

Feeling is what it is. It's neither good nor bad, it's just a feeling. And we get to decide what to make of it, what to do with it exactly, plus stuffing down your emotions all the time, that takes a ton of energy. It's exhausting and you can be probably drained from all of the suppression.

*So what am I saying?*

Acknowledging this stuff and exploring it with somebody you trust; that's going to be way easier than spending a lot of energy suppressing them. It might be scary but it'll be liberating and it'll open up a whole new world for you plus it'll save you a ton of time you waste on hiding them.

## Accept The Way You Feel

So you get angry or sad about something and then you interpret it as bad which means you should stuff that feeling down because it's somehow not right. No!

Your feelings are really not something to fix. Emotions aren't something that you need to get rid of. In fact it's the opposite.

## Explore the basis of the fear and shame

Explore what you learned about emotions. Growing up maybe somewhere along the line you were judged for your feelings, maybe punished for them or perhaps blamed for them in some way or just grew up in a house where you weren't allowed a lot of those feelings.

That will do it too or maybe you were bullied because of them. That will do a number on you and you learned how to shut down those feelings as a way to survive or maybe you soaked up some cultural stuff about how you know, men are supposed to deal with their feelings; “Just stuff them down and then they're not an issue.” 

All of these things are very common but these are the early formative experiences that lead somebody to not have this relationship with their feelings. That's what I would dig into.

## Your Feelings Are Messages To You

These feelings you're avoiding they're not quite as bad as you think. I get that they feel so intense but the judgment, the self-loving that's causing so much more suffering than just the baseline feelings. So if you want relief here there's really only one option. **Start Feeling**

**Your anger?**

It's telling you where you feel powerless. 
**Your anxiety?**

It's telling you that something in your life is off-balance.

**Your fear?**

It's telling you what you care about.

**Your apathy?**

It's telling you where you're overextended and burnt out.

> Your feelings aren't random, they are messengers. And if you want to get anywhere, you need to be able to let them speak to you, and tell you what you really need.

## Learn to understand your emotions instead of suppressing them

The thing about emotions is that the harder you try to control them the more they actually control you. So if you're going to work on yourself it won't be by suppressing or hiding from your feelings, it'll be by giving them more air time in your life and your close relationships and definitely in some therapy.

You're never going to get rid of your emotions but you can change your relationship with your emotions so you can process them differently so they won't control your life in the way that they probably do right now.

You're going to have to start talking and you're going to have to start feeling definitely. You think emotions make you weak which so many of us do right? but really all they do is make you human.

> There's only the meaning we ascribe to those feelings. 

And that's a pretty important reminder for you.

Yeah for sure so time to start feeling. I know you don't want to but it's your only option.


## KEY TAKEAWAYS

- Don't be shy to express the way you feel to another human.
- Feelings are what makes us human. They are those things that separate us from plants :)
- Others can easily connect with you if you are genuine about your feelings and are able to express them
- Having a conversation about how you feel should not end in an argument
- When you are genuine with people about the way you feel, you are able to know those who genuinely care about you. And those who are trying to use you and then you can stay far away from them.
- People are able to offer real support to you if they can understand how you feel. It is hard for anybody to offer you emotional support when you say you are happy or ok when in fact you are sad.
