## Introduction

You already know that relationships are your most important assets, but what are you actually doing about it? It's possible to implement a specific strategy around your relationships that can make them deeper, more productive and ultimately more beneficial.

Let's cover some dives on how and why relationships decay, especially in this day and age. We will also discuss why and how to prioritize your relationships and not merely organize them. And also we will be looking at how to add value to our networks and relationships.

### A Network Is The Best Way To Increase Your Luck

The number of chances you have to get lucky when things aren't going your way is through your network.

The problem is that a lot of people try to create a network when their butts needs saving; and that's often not going to work. Again a lot of people think networking is all about generating net new relationships. It's really not about how to work or how to code-email people but it's how you maintain and increase the value of the relationships that you already have.

### How And Why Relationships Decay

Let's talk a little bit about how and why relationships decay.

Our minds are not very good at maintaining large social networks - which is fine if you grew up in a small town and you knew all the people around in your age and you kind of knew who their parents were, and that was good enough. But now with Internet, we kind of have this problem that we are not evolved to handle.

I mean let's face it, there's this common knowledge that we all know, that we forget things especially overtime. Human beings have always been faced with the issue of memory decay. And it's even been more and more accelerating right now with the amount of information been thrown at us, and we are always been interrupted with new information and new people coming in. And so we are all forced around "building relationships and connections". But the problem is, it is what is causing us to feel weaker and weaker. One of the tests that is common to prove this is to go through your Linkedin connections and think of how many people there you actually know, and even deeper, think of how many people that you know well enough that if they reached out and asked you for 20ghc you'd give it to them. That number will turn out to be significantly small than the total number of contacts you will have.

What we are trying to illustrate here is that we have a lot of really weak contacts that we couldn't even help each other. If you can't lend or borrow 20ghc from somebody how useful is that connection?

Again we see all the same statistics around loneliness in the world, especially social media where everyone is broadcasting their best selves and no one is really kind of going deep. Of a study of 20000 Americans, nearly half said they are lonely. That's kind of scary in a world where we could and should be more connected than ever. We actually feel less and less connected. And that's not just on personal spectrum but on the professional level as well. It's easy to reach out to anyone, it's easy to respond to anyone and that means it's also harder for us to figure out who you should be working with, who you should be responding and who you've not been talking to that you should be talking to in any day.

### We Can't All Be Groomed and Doomed

The great thing out there is that with technology and strategies that we can include in our day to day activities, there is solution. The challenge is that people need to treat this as actual strategy that they implement day to day. Time decay theory essentially shows that memories dull as time passes - we have to reinforce those connections and so using tools and strategies is a great way to do that. It's important to note though that just because someone is fresh in our minds doesn't mean we are fresh in theirs, so we have to be reengaging even if we feel closer to that person because we don't necessarily know if that is reciprocated.

Try and think back to what you had for breakfast two weeks ago and most likely you are not going to know, and you are going to fumble remembering who else you met that day.

### Rebuilding Your Social Connections

One of the key part of the strategies is to talk about intelligence. Building a set of intelligence of what people are really interested in, what they are really excited about, what their challenges are, even their kids name, their hobbies, what their spouse does for living: Understanding all those things is so important to make sure that you maintain the context of that relationship together. The more specific you get the better. *Every interaction we try to make should be meaningful, relevant and authentic.*

### Prioritizing Your Relationships

The core idea behind prioritization is been able to identify who among our thousands of connections who to engage with. So it's not about organizing those relationships but instead prioritization. Often times we might think we want to organize the people around us into important people or very important people, but if we were to instead think about our goals and think about what we are trying to achieve and prioritize around the people that we believe will really be helpful around those goals and we can really be able to provide value to as well, you'd come up with a very different list. The key here is also to not forget people that don't have a readily available sort of value to us. You can focus on the people that you think can help you by maybe following up with them first or if they demand more of your attention and giving it to them because you see a reason to do this, but you should not be ignoring people or not following up with people based on the idea that you can't see what they can do for you - because that will bite you in the ass later. You can have thousands of people that you choose to engage with, some of them honestly you might just be in touch on social media and been their Facebook friend, checking in with them once and every so often if you see something interesting. Whereas on the opposite end, some of them you are reaching out every couple of months. You know everything about their family, you go on trips together, you meet often and really understand what's happening with their business and how you can help out with them.  

### Balancing Your Network

We have to balance our network and not treat it as a new year resolution we do for two weeks and then we forget about it. A lot of people will fall short on improving their relationships because they don't make it specific but on the other hand they are making things *transactional.* We are not necessarily fishing for jobs every time we are reaching out. What we are doing is we are making sure we maintain our relationships because we like them, we care about them and believe that we can provide value for them so that at some point when they are ready for something that we provide, that they think of us.

So relationship building is not about sending pings to your networks hoping for something to come back, but instead it's maintaining again that lock surface area so when something strikes you are ready to go and they think of you.

### TakeAways

- **Time blocking**. Because the initial stages of building and maintaining a relationship is difficult and may require that you do a lot of the work, dedicate time in your day to be checking up on your networks. This can be 15 minutes of your time in the morning. People will remember the kind words they hear from in the morning throughout their day. This will keep you in their memory. During your time blocking, you don't attend to any other thing apart from your network maintaining because that is what you have dedicated that time for. This will ensure that you have an effective time doing this.
- **Act and short term reward**. Human beings are glued to short term reward things. If we can't see the immediate benefit of something we don't want to commit to it. In this case, you will be giving yourself short rewards for been able to reach out to people. These rewards could be in the form of getting yourself a favorite meal, playing a short game or doing something that can reward in a short span of time.
- **Accountability coach.** You can have accountability coach, a friend or someone you've actually paid to this, that will keep you accountable on your network maintaining. This person will be inquiring from you who or how many people you were able to keep in touch with within a day.
- **Tiny habits( two emails to people every morning)**. We are able to perform well or keep up to a bulky task or one that we've assumed so if we can break the task to little chunks of activities. If contacting a significant number of people in a day seem like a great task for you, break the task to at most three people in a day: which will be quite a lot easier. In this way you won't feel the difficulty of the task.

**Our networks are our valuable assets, Treat it as such!**
