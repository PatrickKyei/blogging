> I always refer to networking to the insurance policy that money could never buy.

Without a doubt, networking is the insurance policy that money can never buy, in my opinion. Because when you're at the top like you are right now, I'm sure you receive calls like, "Hey, get me connected to this guy on your network list", "Please assist me in obtaining a ticket to that performance."

The question is, "Where were you before I put you in touch with these individuals you wish to contact? You acted as though you were preoccupied, dude." There's a lot of that. 

You need to create the network before you need it. And I say that a lot because you can't build relationships when you need them. That is tough to achieve.

## Right Way To Re-engage old Connections

When you reach out to someone after many years, and you haven't talked to them, and you went to high school or university with them or anything like that, if you show up and start selling something to them, they'll be like, "Is it going to be Herbalife or Dogecoin? So, what are you trying to sell me? What are you attempting to persuade me to do? I don't know. I'm a little skeptical. What's going on here?"

However, if you contact someone and they are doubtful of you, and you say, "Hey, you know, I've done a terrible job of maintaining my network and contacts. And you've always been a tremendously brilliant person, which I'd like to keep. I'd want to contact you again." 

They could still be wary. They will, however, speak to you for a moment. And then you're gone for three or six months, check in again and let them know what's going on with you. And most likely bring up anything they've been doing that you've been noticing. "Hey, I noticed you did this show," for example. I listened to it and thought you did a wonderful job. But I'm always curious as to what you meant by 'this statement.' I'd like to hear a brief explanation from you.

So, once you've been in contact with them for a while, you may go back and forth "Hello, I've been doing graphic design for six months. And I was wondering if you knew anyone who needed graphic design work." They are now on their way to say, "Yes, indeed. If you don't mind, I'd like to look through your portfolio. And let's see if anyone ever asks me for this kind of stuff. And I'd be pleased to recommend you."

If you do it on a large enough scale you're building trust. You're rekindling old friendships.

## Reach out to people before you Need Something

Make a list of everyone with whom you have lost contact. Those with whom you have not maintained contact. They're your dormant and frail ties, right? Or, at the very least, your inactive network ties. Reach out to them before you need something, otherwise they'll say, "Huh? Isn't it Herbalife or Dogecoin?."

It'll just be like sharpening a dull machete, right? You're going to rekindle that connection. You're essentially confessing, "Hey, I moved, and I never really reached out to you again. That was a blunder. I hope you're still running that popular program. I'd appreciate an update. Here's what I'm up to, here's a photo of my child. I truly don't want anything more than to reignite this since you're a highly clever person. I want more individuals like you in my circle."

Carry it out. You'll be shocked by how many people reach back out and say, "Hey, I was wondering what had happened to you. I was telling my wife the other day that we were wondering what you were up to and whether you'd never married or had a child."

That sort of thing, re-engaging those weak dormant connections. That will teach you that doing this thing sooner is a good thing.

## Build A Habit of Keeping Touch

This is a habit that you may develop as well. Every morning, before you get out of bed, check your phone. Open your text messaging app, which may be Whatsapp these days. Scroll to the bottom of the page. And that's where your ex-girlfriends, ex-boyfriends, whatever — bypass those folks, but then you can — or not, you know, whatever, but those are the very weak connections, the really inactive relationships.

Let's go ahead and catch up with them right now. Catch up with the person you met at the conference and you had a great chat, exchanged contact information, but you never heard from them again. Send them a 'Lets get in touch message.'

Assume that half of them do not respond. Or they say something like, "Who is this?" And it's no longer the same person's phone. You have the option to remove them. However, two or three of the four persons who say, "Oh my God, it's been a lifetime. I haven't heard from you in a long time. What exactly is going on? I sell bicycles in Nigeria. To hell with the media, I reasoned. Tell me what you're up to."

You're also re-engaging those folks. And if you do it every day, say five days a week, that's four individuals every day. That's 20 individuals a week, 80 people a month that you're re-engaging, assuming a 50% response rate for the sake of math. That will very certainly be higher. That's a lot of folks for whom you are currently top of mind. And they're in your thoughts right now.

So you know that this individual has recently launched a legal firm and may benefit from some immigration law clients. They are aware that you are hosting a graphic design workshop, thus they will keep you in mind. And I guarantee you that every week or close to it, an opportunity from your phone will present itself as a result of this re-engaging.

## Tiny Habits bring RESULTS

You don't have to spend $8,000 to attend expensive parties, network, and mingle. You may simply use your existing connections and gradually expand over time. You're significantly more likely to see fitness improvements if you go to the gym for 20 minutes a day, four or five days a week than if you go once every other month. It all comes down to consistency. If you don't have time to exercise, go for a stroll every day, walk a mile, and you'll get greater results than attempting to run a 10K every 90 days.

And I constantly say, "Always be charitable, always help people, always be generous," because you never know what chance awaits you. You never know who will be able to assist you or who will be able to help you in generating referral currency.

So, instead of pondering what's in it for you, be as generous as you can afford to be with as many people as you can. You don't know where such opportunities are or whether they exist if they are over the horizon. So, if you are always assisting others in obtaining what they desire, you're always on someone's mind.

Those folks will begin to return if you continue to demonstrate charity. Even if just one person out of a hundred can assist you, that's great since this is incredibly scalable, right? You could do it a hundred times a day, a hundred times a week, and a hundred times a month. All you need is one or two individuals from that hundred to help you get back on your feet, and you'll have made a life and career for yourself.
