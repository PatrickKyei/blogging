You can win at life if you look at failures as wins.


> The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. —Michio Kaku

**You have the world's most powerful super computer in your head.**

Let me tell you a story:

_7 years ago I felt unfilled with what I was doing._

_Work felt ordinary and the cycle of repeated task became boring._

_I quit my job._

_Traveled to a new city to have a different experience at life._

_Things became more interesting because the task I got assigned was slightly above my experience level and not too difficult to deal with._

_Just like the way hitting a new difficulty level in a video game challenges your skills and makes playing the game exciting._

_I led my team to solve multiple challenges in the business and I am proud to say that the business is still operating._

_Boredom is a struggle for me. At certain points I decide to pursue new things in my life._

_I realized that life becomes meaningful when I am solving a problem that requires my attention, focus and skill._

You are a Value Creator. 

If you can solve a problem at your job that solves the pain points of the customers of your company, you are qualified to start a business.

Everyone is built to be an entrepreneur. 

If you strip away the business label and processes. 

It's just solving problems for a living like we did before the industrial revolution.

Yes the path to entrepreneurship is individual but everyone has the same problems.

There are four eternal markets in business you can explore: 
 - health
 - wealth
 - relationships
 - happiness

It took me 3 years of failing to find something I love doing. ( I build stuff on the internet and pass down the knowledge)

I quit my second job to build something off the ground.

This was my first experience putting every resource: money, skill, network, together to build something off the ground on the internet.

We burnt lots of cash.
We had many sleepless nights.
We had lots of failures in many places.

However in business:

 - Every failure is a lesson
 - Every failure builds character.
 - Every failure brings you closer to discovering and fulfilling
your purpose

If you started anything new and you are faced with hardships, failures and disappointments.

Keep in mind that every experience serves a bigger purpose.



Stories give meaning to life.

Your mindset and identity is the story you tell yourself.

You will live out that story on auto if not brought in front of your conscious mind.

If not made conscious, it is impossible for it to end in your favor.

Most people don't start a business because of one thing.

Time.

I understand it. It can be a lot.

You feel you can't just quit your job and pursue something you don't know is going to pay off.

And so you postpone what you want to do to tomorrow.

How you've been conditioned to making money has hugely impacted how you think about the process of making money. 

You think you can only make money by working a job and expecting a paycheck at the end of every month. 

When was the last time you read a business book? 
When was the last time you attended a business seminar?
When was the last time you listened to a business podcast?

The difference between an employee and an entrepreneur is control over your potential.

Everyone is an entrepreneur. 

Some just choose to get paid for the problems they solve in their personal life.

If you don't create a career, you'll be assigned one. 

Business is how 

 - You solve a problem in your life that births a profitable solution.

 - Build an audience by distributing your value through content and writing.

 - Turn your solution into a product and iterate until you make as much as you want.

 - Don't rely on a paycheck for your survival. 

 - Transcend your survival through entrepreneurship and remove the earning limit from your life.

You don't need more time.

You just need to know your 'why'.

Motivation is fleeting and hard to fall back on when you're exhausted from work or you have other responsibilities.

For me, discovering I can build a business on the internet completely changed the way I saw business.

You'd be surprised how easy it is to make your first dollar using only a laptop.

Turn your ideas into a one-person digital business.

"But how Patrick?!"

If you have no idea where to start, stop overthinking.

Just start somewhere.

Find something you enjoy, see where it's working for other people then replicate.

**Reverse engineer things.**

It’s a rule of any business. 

1. Find what works 
2. Add a slight tweak to make it better

If that tweak makes a large enough splash, people will come flooding to you.

Don't try to reinvent the wheel.

Over time you'll learn more about what works and what you enjoy.

The key is to get over this first hurdle.

That's how I made over ₵5,000 in less than a month passing down the knowledge in my head.

It started as my genuine passion to get out of my bored mind.

People think it's wonderful to retire and they're going to do whatever they want to do; play golf or go swimming or go to the Resorts.

But after a while they get bored and they don't know what to do with their lives and many of them die. 

It's really important to have some reason to be existing and so what I really like is to keep busy with a personal project.

You need a project.

Not just any project, but something that ignites your passion and commands your attention.

Why? Because a project gives you purpose. It's the North Star guiding you through the sea of distractions.

Build a project that actualizes your ideal future.

You don't need to quit your job ( this is the ideal choice because business requires focus and attention initially but if you can't do that )  to make decent money on the side.

It just takes focus and commitment.

It is your job to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.

If you don’t know what to build, start with:

 - What you already use, but make it better. 
 - A problem you’ve solved in your life. 
 - Building what you want to see in the world. 

If you want to be the person that creates wealth solve problems.

## If I were to start a business in 2024 this is how I'd go about it:

 - 1 hour of writing.
 - 1 hour of building.
 - 1 hour of learning.
 - 1 hour of networking.

This simple formula holds the key to unlocking a future where you're not just working to live but living to thrive.

Imagine dedicating just one hour each day to these four pillars of growth.

### 1 Hour of Writing

In the 1 hour of writing, you're not just jotting down words, you're crafting the narrative of your journey, honing your voice, and sharing your wisdom with the world.

Write to distribute ideas.

Writing is not a skill, it's a way of life.

- Capture ideas
- Connect ideas
- Create ideas
- Articulate ideas
- Share ideas

Writing is how you become a vessel for value.

Every situation becomes a meaningful opportunity to collect valuable information to share with the world.

Everything you need to write and post  on social media has been Simplified here in my [Social Media Writing Simplified](https://nas.io/skillembassy/tusf)

Everyone is creative, but most people forget they have the power to achieve anything they want in life.

Looks decrease with time, intelligence increases with time.

Both are important, but one is a much better bet for your future.

### 1 Hour of Building

You build the foundation of your dreams, brick by brick, line by line.

Build something tangible and lasting.

Nobody will give you money for free.

Create a solution to a problem.

Persuade people to buy the solution.

Learn how to build and sell.

Money becomes easy to get.

### 1 Hour of Learning

Expand your mind, acquire new skills.

Stay ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving world.

Learning is the foundation of the human experience.

Educate yourself. 

When a question about a certain topic pops up, google it. 

Watch movies and documentaries.

When something sparks your interest, read about it. 

Read read read. 

Study, learn, stimulate your brain. 

Don't just rely on the school system, educate that beautiful mind of yours.

Learn skills that cannot be learned in school. 

Follow your curiosities and solve your own problems for personal evolution.

And get results that cannot be achieved in employment.

Use the Internet as a creative extension of yourself.

### 1 Hour of Networking

Cultivate relationships, forge partnerships, and build a community that supports and uplifts you on your journey.

Do this every day for a year, and you'll see the transformation unfold before your eyes. 

You'll have a brand that resonates, a business that thrives, and a career that fulfills you in ways you never thought possible.

Someone with a great network and good connections will achieve 10x your success with a 10th of your effort. 

Not many things in life can be obtained purely by merit.

The who-you-know factor is more important than you realize. 

Anyone who tells you that their success was achieved purely through hard work is probably lying to you.

I hope this helps. Talk soon!
