Cry but start running while you cry.

Whiling in self pity? You are allowed to be sad but you have to keep moving forward.

You can rebuild and be sad at the same time.

The parallel processing and execution from pain.  
Use pain as a fuel.

Pain is information.

As a child, you touched something hot, and it burned you.  
That pain gave you a piece of information: be careful touching hot things.

When you sign up to run a marathon, you are signing up for pain.

But whether or not you keep running is up to you.  
There's a popular saying, "pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional."

You can choose pain without choosing suffering.

Pain is information, and information is painful.

Rewiring your brain is not a friction-less process.  
Some knowledge can only be discovered the hard way.

The sooner you can convert pain into knowledge, the sooner you can experience the next useful pain.

Don’t put yourself through the same pain too many times. To access new information you must experience new pains.

“Knowledge is power”. If pain is information, then pain can be converted to power.

To do so, you must learn to control your suffering, accept that scars are beautiful.

If you felt pain, ask what information it gave you. If that information was useful, seek the next pain.

You are learning.

If you snap back to comfort and pleasure at the first hint of pain, your mind is programmed to rarely encounter meaning in life.

You experience pain because you are going through a tough phase in life where your old self is gone, and your new self is still in the making.

You're in the middle of changing.

You change who you are by gradually exposing yourself to – and digesting – new information with study and practice. The change will not be instant.

I have been through some of the most painful events in my life.

Businesses I started have failed.  
I made investments that became my loss.  
I have taken some steps in my life that have left physical scars.

But those were learning moments for me.

The human brain is a prediction machine.  
It is continuously taking in your surroundings and analysing the information it comes across.

When something registers in your brain as pain, your mind will do everything to avoid it next time.

All behaviour is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it.	

Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing	pain and you want to relieve it.

These are the three things that will guide you to turn pain into success.

**One is awareness.**

Become aware of the pain  
Is it physical or emotional?  
Do you understand the complexity of the pain  
And how it affects your life?

**Two is relevance.**

How relevant is it to your everyday life?  
What's in it for you if you find the root cause?  
What are the potential benefits of solving it?

**Three is effort.**

How fast will you achieve the result?  
How can you solve the pain? is it through  
Education, entertainment or inspiration?  
And is that easy to achieve?

Either way, the purpose of every action is to deal with the problems you face.

Pain helps you to learn.  
Pain protects you from danger.

Pain is the information you need to make better informed decisions.  
It is your personal feedback hub.

Just because you feel bad doesn't mean you should change your plan.  
Pain is a part of any worthwhile goal.

Before SpaceX was successful, Elon Musk experienced three failed launches.
"You have to learn those hard lessons."

> ​"I messed up the first three launches, the first three launches failed. Fortunately the fourth launch – that was the last money that we had – the fourth launch worked, or that would have been it for SpaceX. But fate liked us that day," said Elon Musk in 2017.

Pain drives us to change more than motivation does.  
Most people do everything to avoid it by chasing cheap dopamine.

Pain leads to growth.  
Nothing can stand in your growth if you turn your pain into fuel.  
Develop emotional control. Attain mental mastery. All pain, starts from the mind

When you are in deep emotional pain there are only 2 things you can do

1. Use it as rocket fuel for growth
2. Let it consume you to the point of no return

The choice is obvious

You don't have to chase pain and problems, but you need to understand that you can't avoid it. There will be times in your life that you will experience excruciating pain, but they will hurt less if you are aware that they're supposed to be there.

You need the pain of the lesson for the lesson to stick.  
Those pain points will shape your next course of action.

And in the end  
The pain will go away.  
The fruits of your labor will stay.

Do not get addicted to escaping pain.  
Face your life.  
Handle your business and win.  
No battle was ever won by people who ran.
