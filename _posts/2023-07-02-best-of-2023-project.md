From beginning of the year, I spent more time indoors, no parties and more time studying. 

The idea was to explore new career fields and excercise my brain.

Plunged myself into Coursera MOCC online learning platform. 

I took courses in Data Analytics, IT Support, Business Intelligence and Digital Marketing. The previous year I'd enrolled in UX Design and Project Management and had completed. So this was good addition to me. You check out my [dashboard](https://www.credly.com/users/patrick-kyei)

In the span of 6 months I studied night and day to complete these Certificate courses. They provided hands-on activities as portfolio projects.

For the next few months what I want to do is gather all the projects resources to include in my portfolio projects, refine those that needs some touches and take up new ones to improve whatever skills I gained. 


I feel this is going to be fun. You can check my [projects page](https://patrickkyei.com/projects/), this is where I will be updating the list. Stay tuned.
