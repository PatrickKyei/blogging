People spend a lot of time online either to consume or create content, keep in touch with family and friends or entertain themselves. Business activites are also conducted over the internet everyday. So the internet has become part of our normal daily lives.

Day in and day out, hackers try many ways to get access to your personal information or critical information of your business or customers. If one method fails, they resort to other methods.

After completing the Google Cybersecurity course, I became more aware of the different offensive attacks that goes on day to day on the internet.

So let's walk through a practical way of keeping safe online. Stay through to the end because I will tools and resources that will also help you to be more aware and how to stay safe online.

> Here's an example of a typical phishing message which contains a link which appears to be from Facebook.
{: .prompt-warning}

In this account someone sends a message through messenger telling me my account will be disabled. The hacker adds a link that i should click for verification. 

### Check for emails in your mail box

The first red flag is that I didn't receive any email from Facebook. For important information like this, it is likely the company your account is connected will send you an email which is registered with the user.

Because I am investigating this I went ahead to click the link. In your case, as soon as you identify a link to be harmful **delete immediately**

Usually some the things that will give out a suspicious attack are mispellings or wrongful information.
