> Your last miskake is your biggest teacher.

Tell me a man that never made a mistake and I will show you a man that never tried and that never grows.

Growth requires freedom to make mistakes. Only that those mistakes can sometimes cost us a lot. But those things are part of life. Can we say we will never try again? No!

> Every mistake is an opportunity to grow wiser.

In life, we learn the lessons only after we face the test. Which could be sometimes painful. But what we can do is learn from those mistakes we made so that we don't repeat them again when we face the same or similar ones in the future.

How we can do that is to take the lessons from our own mistakes or learn the lessons other people have discovered from the tests they have faced in life.

I am sharing some lessons from this situation I faced in my life.

## Sunshine

I had sunshine and it was one of the beautiful things in my life. Things felt lively and it was evident in many aspect of my life. Tough times were bearable because there was always some sunshine to give you the energy to make things grow again.

And then the rains showed up. I was not prepared for the rain. I feared too much of it was going to kill everything that has started doing well from the sunshine I was getting.

I begged that the rain stop. I didn't realize I needed it to rain adequately in order for the sunshine to stay shining. However, I requested that it leave, and as a result, the sunshine did not appear. After that, things started to go south.

Although it was a very terrible moment in my life, I have made it more tolerable so that we may concentrate on the lesson.

After a careful retrospective, this is what I learned:

## 1. Don't take decisions in the heat of the moment

When faced with a serious situation and in a condition of confusion, avoid making a decision. Allow at least 42 hours of thought time before making a decision if possible. If this is not possible and you must make a decision anyway, proceed to point 2.

## 2. Consult an unbiased opinion

It's never a bad idea to have a second opinion. When your thoughts are clouded by uncertainty and you can't see the consequence of a decision you're about to make but need to make regardless, it's best to get an unbiased opinion from one or two trustworthy people.

In your story, don't play the victim. If at all possible, present the situation without focusing on yourself, and then let them lay down the cards depicting the many outcomes of the various measures you could take.

It will help you in seeing things from multiple perspectives and guiding you to make less harmful decisions.

## 3. There is a positive side in any bad situation

Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes I know, as corny as it may sound, there is always a silver lining to every bad situation. There is a silver lining to a lot of what we go through in life. If you take your time and consider the two points above, you'll most likely see the positive side of whatever circumstance you're in.

I failed to see that a little rainfall would have added some freshness to the scene, making it more lovely.

I'll let you determine what these opportunities are because you know your situation better than I do. They are, nevertheless, usually present. And once you've discovered them, you must take immediate action. Because they're almost often the reason you had to go through a disaster to begin with.

On the other hand, you will emerge stronger. Because I did, I'm confident you will.

## 4. Learn, Take responsibility and forgive yourself

Making mistakes while attempting to figure things out is perfectly acceptable. The goal is to live a fulfilled life rather than a flawless one.

Accept responsibility and accept your flaws after recognizing you've made a poor choice. Don't try to pass the blame for the bad outcome on to others. If you do that, you will learn nothing.

Finally, you must forgive yourself for your mistakes. Recognize that anyone, and I mean anyone, can make a mistake. Don't wallow in self-pity. Instead of shaming yourself, respond to yourself with love.

## 5. Never Say Never

One thing I've discovered is that it's quite difficult to forgive oneself if you fix your mind that you will **never** make bad choices. It's difficult to forgive oneself if you vow you'd never do something and then do it.

Take a gentle approach to life. Recognize that life has a habit of putting us in difficult situations, and that we may not always be able to see things clearly at first.

So don't be too hard on yourself.

## 6. Grow Wiser

Grow. Grow. Grow. Every setback is an opportunity to learn something new.

Make a list of the things you could have done better once you've identified them. Make a note or a journal entry about the lesson learnt.

In the future, you'll be better prepared with a mature approach to similar or identical events. Not just for yourself, but also for the sake of others.

> Hey why not, I still pray for **Sunshine**.
