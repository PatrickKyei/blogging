> Your last miskake is your biggest teacher.

Tell me a man that never made a mistake and I will show you a man that never tried and that never grows.

Growth requires freedom to make mistakes. Only that those mistakes can sometimes cost us a lot. But those things are part of life. Can we say we will never try again? No!

> Every mistake is an opportunity to grow wiser.

In life, we learn the lessons only after we face the test. Which could be sometimes painful. But what we can do is learn from those mistakes we made so that we don't repeat them again when we face the same or similar ones in the future.

How we can do that is to take the lessons from our own mistakes or learn the lessons other people have discovered from the tests they have faced in life.

I have faced such tests, made some terrible mistakes, and learned from them. I am sharing some lessons from this story with you.

## Sunshine

I had sunshine and it was one of the beautiful things in my life. Things felt lively and it was evident in many aspect of my life. Tough times were bearable because there was always some sunshine to give you the energy to make things grow again.

And then the rains showed up. I was not prepared for the rain. I feared too much of it was going to kill everything that has started doing well fro  the sunshine I was getting.

I asked for the rains to go away. Not knowing I needed it to fall heavily for the sun to keep shining. But I asked it to go away and so the sunshine didn't show up. And then everything started going  southside.

From All of these, these are the lessons I learned:

## 1. Don't take decisions in the heat of the moment

When dealing with a critical situation and in your state of confusion don't take a decision. If it is possible allow at least 42hrs of thinking time over it before coming to a resolution. If it is not possible and you need to take a decision as soon as possible, then do point 2.

## 2. Consult an unbiased opinion

Two heads are always better than one. When your thoughts are clouded by confusion and you are not able to see clearly the outcome of a decision you are going to take but need to take one anyway, it is better to consult an unbiased opinion from one or two reliable people.

Don't play a victim in your story. If possible, lay out the state of the situation without focusing it on you and then let them lay out the cards of the possible outcomes of the various steps you could take.

It will help you see things from different point of view and guide to take less damaging decisions.

## 3. There is a positive side in any bad situation

I know.. I know.. I know but as cliche as this may sound there is some positive side in any bad situation. There is a silver lining in a lot these stuff that we go through. If you slow down and do the two steps above, you are likely going to find the positive side in the situation you find yourself.

I missed to see that a little rainfal would have actually made things more beautiful as would bring some freshness into the scene.

You know your situation better than I do so I will let you decide what these opportunities are. But they are always there. And when you find them you've got to jump on them. Because they always end up been the reason you kind of have to go through shitstorm in the first place.

You will come out stronger on the other side. I know you will because I did.

## 4. Learn, Take responsibility and forgive yourself

There is no shame in making mistakes while trying to figure things out. The goal is to live a fulfilling life, not a perfect one.

After realizing you've made a bad decision, take responsibility and accept your faults. Don't try to shift blame to others because of the horrible outcome. You will learn nothing if you do that.

And finally forgive yourself for the mistakes you have made. Understand that everybody, I mean everybody, can make mistakes. Don't wallow in shame. Respond to yourself in a loving way rather than a self-shaming way.

## 5. Never Say Never

One of the things I noticed is that it's really really difficult to forgive yourself if you fix your mind or what you will never do. If you say you would **"never"** do something and you do that, then it's really hard to forgive yourself. 

Take a gentle approach to life. Know that life has a way of throwing us in tight situations and may not always be able to see right throught to things at first. 

So don't be too hard on yourself.

## 6. Grow Wiser

Grow. Grow. Grow. Every mistake is an opportunity to grow wiser. 

When you are able to identify what you could have done better, write them down somewhere. Save the lesson as a note or a journal. 

You'd be better equiped with a more mature response to the same or similar situations like that in the future. Not just for yourself but for others.

> Hey why not, I still pray for **Sunshine**.
