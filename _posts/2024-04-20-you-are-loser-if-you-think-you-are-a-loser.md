Life happens. This is something you have absolutely no control over. 

What you have control over, to some degree is how you respond to it.

At a certain point I felt the burden of life over my shoulders.

I felt I was a loser.

I saw myself as a loser because I hadn't achieved certain expectations of society.

I was thrown in a deep pit of self pity, regrets, low self confidence and a poor outlook on life.

Everything changed when I had a different perspective of the situation.

The first time I watched the story of how Elon Musk built his Space X company was a turn around for me.

"Elon had gone to Russia to negotiate a deal to buy space rockets for future mission to Mars.

The Russians wanted $8 million dollars for a single rocket.  
Elon was willing to pay the $8 million dollars, but for  that price, he wanted two rockets. 

The Russians held firm to their original pricing and wouldn’t  cut a deal with Elon, so he stormed out of the meeting into the freezing Moscow air outside and  took a cab back to the airport.

He became obsessed with knowing all he could about rocket technology, reading as many books as he could on the topic.

Musk founded SpaceX in 2002, and has since developed a series of next-generation rockets that can deliver payloads to space.

In 2010, SpaceX became the first private company to launch a spacecraft into orbit and bring it back to Earth."

>People that introduce you to new ways of thinking and new ways of seeing life are so important.

Your perspective shapes your reality.

If you believe you can't do something, you will live your whole life believing you can't do it.

If someone showed you how it's possible because they did it, you are set free from that mental prison.

Change starts from the mind.

If your mindset sucks,  

Nothing will work.

The right mindset makes everything right.

- If your life sucks try new things.  
- If you feel you are not making any progress try new things.  
-If your mind is clogged and your perspective looks blurred try new things.  
- If you feel a limit on your mental ability and creative potent try new things.

Try and find a thing that you really enjoy. 

Try and find a thing that you're passionate about.

For me early on it was reading. 

And it progressed to writing.

I wanted to be an author.

Then it went from reading novels and writing poems and letters to my high school crush to another thing.

It was just another thing that I was extremely passionate about.

I dived into reading engineering books and then watching Youtube videos on how people build websites and Softwares.

I listened to Podcasts that talked about how companies were built.  
To me understanding came from diving deeper into topics that were new to me.

This exposed me to design, marketing, coding, sales, philosophy and writing.

This was my vehicle out of my dilemma.  
This was my vehicle out of my own anxiety,  
self pity,  
regrets,  
low self confidence,  
and a poor outlook on life.

Find something that you genuinely enjoy because getting good at
things you genuinely enjoy is extremely beneficial to your spiritual and physical growth.

Every person thinks they are a loser until they find something they genuinely love doing. Then work becomes like play.

I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I learned how to design.  
I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I learned how to code.  
I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I started an [Internet business.](https://skillembassy.org)  
I didn't know I wasn't a loser until I started winning.

Coding taught me that I could get better at stuff.  
I wasn't a loser. I was just someone in a f*cked up situation.

What you can do:  
Channel all that energy into something and get better at it.

I went from someone who was incredibly insecure and basically a failure to someone who was really confident and self motivated.

And then all of a sudden people started to admire me.  
**Nothing happens, then everything happens.**

I went from an insecure person and a failure to someone who was really successful at this one thing that was considered hard and other people were scared of.


That gave me immense confidence and also a real understanding of the direct correlation between the hardwork and success.

This can be applied to different areas of life.

The glass ceiling on your mind will affect your
relationships,
business,
career,
health.

Quit thinking like a loser.
Start thinking like a winner.

Perspective shapes reality.

Your perspective is shaped by the stuff you let into your zone.

If you're constantly feeding your brain
 - junk food,
 - mindless TV, 
 - gossip magazines, 
 - endless scrolling through social media

expect a clogged mindset limited by self pity and anxiety.

But flip the script. 

Surround yourself with great and useful stuff:
- podcasts, 
- inspiring books, 
- well informed articles
- wonderful personalities

suddenly, your perspective starts to shift. You're exposed to new ideas, different viewpoints, and before you know it, you're seeing the world through a whole new lens.

Pay attention to what you consume, my friend.  
Because whether you realize it or not, it's shaping your reality. 

Want great ideas? Consume great content. It's that simple.

## Lessons to learn here:

#### We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on that

Find out what you are excellent at and what genuinely excites you.

Take small steps toward it every day, and set aside the larger vision for a time.

For the time being, follow your curiosity; if you do this regularly, it will gradually prod you towards your purpose.

#### Rid yourself of negative self talk

Take charge of who you are and what you want for yourself.

Stop downplaying what you care about and your hopes.

- Own your fire  
- Own your no-saying and yes-saying  
- Take charge of your emotions and mood  
- Take control of your desires, ideas, and perceptions  
- Take charge of your plans, your path, and your success  

Almost every successful person begins with two convictions: 
1. the future can be better than the present  
2. and I have the ability to make it so.

#### Surround yourself with like minded people

A lot of things also come down to identity. 

Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible.

Therefore make sure the people you move with share similar visions and goals with you.

Otherwise you will lose your sense of purpose and get distracted towards your goals and journey to a better version of yourself.

#### Read books no one reads

Read on topics that interest you that you don’t know much about.

_George R.R. Martin once said, “I have lived a thousand lives and I have loved a thousand loves. I’ve walked on distant worlds and seen the end of time. Because I read.”_

It is enjoyable, inexpensive, and beneficial to read books.

A single best selling book will keep you entertained for several hours.

As well as prompt you to analyze and reassess certain aspects of the world around you.

And, what’s more, you can get that one book for almost nothing.

#### Drastically reduce your time on social media

You are unaware of many mental processes that occur when you are doom scrolling on social media.

What is genuine and truthful in your story becomes clouded.

You don’t consciously think about it, yet it happens all the time.

It may mostly influence your confidence and self-worth, especially if you start comparing our lives to those you see on social media, which are frequently not as they appear.

Spend more time reading, building, trying new things, spending time in nature.

Those are the approaches to live a genuine life.

To use social media:

Log in,  
get what you want,  
log off,  
go touch some grass.

### Start changing slowly, take baby steps. 

Slow but steady progress.

There’s nothing more attractive than someone who knows exactly what they want and are dedicated to get it.

Make this shift in your life.  
Start with baby steps as you grow into the person you want to become.

Just as the saying goes, “Dream big and Start small.”

Hope this helps. Talk soon.
