## Introduction

There are fundamental concepts that push and pull us as humans. It is important and would be great if the people we live with in our various societies are aware of them. I think it would eliminate a little of the part that makes living with each other a difficult thing to deal with.

We have to understand these about ourselves so that we are not taken advantage of by others and also to know our own weaknesses and vulnerabilities, whether they are getting triggered or we can possibly eliminate them.

### Poking into the Human Behavior

We are flawed individuals. We all evolve from the same roots and we can't control who we are to a larger extend. Sometimes we feel very powerful emotions and we may act stupid based on these emotions and often this is very human. Some people like to exempt themselves. They even go about to say, "I am never aggressive", "I am not a narcissist it is the other person", "I am just so sweet, it is the other people who are aggressive", so on and so forth. But this is who we are. It is not to be depressing. This is actually what human behavior is. Everybody wants to think they can

change themselves, that is why self-help books sell so well. But if you don't have self awareness, you can't possibly change yourself.

The human behavior is not all negative. We have some positive traits.

When you have the awareness that you are capable of been angry, aggressive, envious, been irrational at times, then you can actually start to change yourself. Instead of going around in circles or deluding yourself that you are changing when in fact you are not.The Liberating fact

You go around thinking everything is personal. Asking yourself a lot of questions why someone treated you in a certain way. But everything is not personal and that is the liberating fact.

People are wrapped up in their own emotions, traumas, even living things from their childhood. And you are not really the trigger. The trigger is something that happened to them when they were four or five or twenty or whatever. So to realize that it is not personal; people are acting after their own drama, trauma, their own emotional problems from way back, kind of take all the burden away from you. So the fact that you don't have to react and take things personally is extremely liberating.

### Humans are Social Animals

Now the things is, we are social animals to the core. We are molded by people; parents, teachers, spouses, friends. So we are not really individuals. We are built by other people by been social. We kind of are a mold of all these other interactions and relationships. And so we are really generally bad at that aspect of life because we don't understand other people. We take it like a set of simple snapshot of people. They are nice, they are not nice. They are pleasant, they not pleasant. They are smart, they are not smart. But people are infinitely complicated complex. They have a wealth of emotions, they are going through things that you are not even beginning to see. And if you can begin to pierce their mask and get inside their psychology and understand where they are coming from, suddenly the whole game changes. And what you say and how you act with them changes as well and you will find your relationships are much more smoother. Your bonds with people will be much more deeper and you will be able to deal with those ugly toxic types that inevitably cross your path.

### Our Default Position in Life

Our default position is to always want things to be fun and easy. We often take the path of least resistance. So as social beings, we need people to instill in us the sense of discipline otherwise we would grow up to be monsters. Our higher nature is growing up developing our behaviors to be appropriate and disciplined. Whenever you stop thinking about yourself and start putting your might into your work or put your mind into other people and their problems, you are tapping into that higher nature. And this feels good. It feels fulling. It doesn't feel fulling to go home, smoke weed and just play a video game. It's kind of fun and mindless sometimes. But the next day you don't feel any sense of accomplishment. There is no sense of the "ahuh I'm doing something, I'm building something." And we want that feeling. So that is our higher nature. I believe that we can naturally feel envy. Everybody feels envy and we don't like admitting it. Where that comes from is the chimpanzee in us. It's been shown that primates are very attuned to other animals in their clan and they are constantly comparing themselves; "Who is the alpha chimp who has more than I have?" In our minds we are constantly comparing ourselves to others. The other has a better job, they are making more money, their book is selling more etc. And deep underneath it is the source of envy. But that constant comparing ourselves which is so endemic on social media has the potential of been turned into something positive. You can turn it into the desire to compete, and instead of envying what the other person has, you can actually achieve it for yourself.

Often times in life somebody will do a kind of ugly surprising nasty thing to us. They sabotage our work, they will say something ugly behind our back, they literally manipulate us in some way. And we get drawn into the emotions of all that and we don't really understand where it came from. And most of the time where it actually comes from is envy. And we cannot unravel that because we don't see it originally.

### Active and Passive Envy

Passive envy is what we feel everyday naturally. As we look on facebook we see other people having a great vacation and we ask, "Why are their life better than mine damn it" We feel that everyday and we need to admit it. It is very human. And it doesn't lead to anything bad necessarily.

Active envy can happen to anybody but generally there are people who are envious types. And they are prone to feel such strong envy they act on it. They not only just sort of feel it, they give you a comment that is targeted to make you feel bad. And so a couple of things will start happening. You may start internalizing that or you will kind of attack them. And what you don't realize is that comes from a place of envy; they actually envy you. And if you know that, you can prepare and make sure that you don't become friends with them, and you can also not take it personal.

### Identifying an Envious Personality

People give off a lot of information by their body language; by their looks, by their tone of voice. And envious persons can be unmasked by their micro expressions. By their tone of voice they may be praising you and say something good but their tone of voice is kind of cold and it is to make you wonder whether there is something else going on.

If you say something good about yourself and you see a flash of disappointment in their eyes which only lasts for a second and they quickly cover it over, know you are dealing with an envious person.

This is also common with people who gossip a lot. They say bad things about people and it is really to disguise how envious they are about the people they gossip about. If somebody is in a hurry to tell you a bad news, you must realize that there is something else going on.

### Our Complicated Personality

People are complicated. No one really feels pure envy. There is always a mix with other things. I want you to get over your simplified idea of people. Their anger is not just purely anger. Their love and affection can also be mixed with a bit of resentment and hatred and envy. So people are more complex than you think. That would be a doubling confusion. But in fact envy is most common among friends and among people in the same profession. And you don't really expect it from friends, you expect something else. Yes the friends who tell you these things, they can be your friends, they can still be nice and generous but there is also an under curve where they envy your success. And that kind of situation needs tolerance. I don't think you should necessary break off a relationship or think this person is going to ruin your life or something, unless you have a sign there is something going on. I believe you should sort of accept it; this is what we were talking about - the liberating aspect. It might happen that youÂ are really doing well, you are successful and maybe they are not doing so well or they are having things in their life that are not clicking and they are feeling some envy. You are not going to take it personal. You are not going to get drawn into their drama and getting all emotionally perturbed.

### The Awareness is a Positive thing

You must not be weighed down and feel guilty to know that you can feel envy. The fact that that happens to you is totally normal and human. And it shouldn't depress you or make you feel that you have to completely change yourself. Just by the fact that you are aware of it is almost enough, so that it will not turn into this ugly active envy.

Most of the people around you who are ugly envious have no self awareness. They don't think of themselves as ever feeling envy. They feel that their sabotaging you is justified because they convinced themselves that you are an asshole that deserves something bad. But the fact that you can recognize the root of it is already enough to prevent you from going to the deep ugly place.

### Changing the Undesirable Part of Us

You have to first be willing to be honest with yourself to want to change this aspect of your character.

You are going to envy people who are in the same situation or above you. I don't envy my carpenter who got a great new job working on a house. I am happy for him. But a writer who suddenly rises to fifty-five on Amazon when I am seventy-seven, I'm going feel envy for him. Look at the people in your profession, your dislike about that fellow, ninety-nine percent show it comes from a point of envy. From that place, that degree of honesty will help you work to completely deal with it.

For instance, we always envy people who have more than us have or who are better than us. But there a lot of people around the world who are also doing worse than you. So the opposite of envy is gratitude; when you feel grateful for what you have as opposed to envying what other people have. You can always feel grateful that you are alive, that you are healthy, that you've got your brain and wit about you, that you have some decent job and that you have some people in your life. Why don't you look at the people who have a lot less than you and instead of feeling envy for those who are better, you feel grateful for what you have.
