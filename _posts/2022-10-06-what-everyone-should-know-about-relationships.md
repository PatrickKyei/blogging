1. **Love isn’t painful**. Growth is painful, but love shouldn’t hurt you, keep you up at night, make you question your sanity or make you miserable.

2. **Unconditional love means just that, unconditional**. But don’t confuse it with abuse. You can’t love someone to change them. They have to want it themselves and until then, you’re wasting your time.

3. **Every relationship you have, being romantic or friendship has an underlying lesson**. Being able to spot the lesson and adjust accordingly is the tough part.

4. **Communication is extremely important**. Without being heard and listening, the relationship will be doomed from the start. Understanding one another is very important. When your partner feels heard and is shown they are prioritized can make all the difference.

5. **A partner should add to what you already have**. If you are running empty somewhere in your spiritual or emotional self all the time, it’s f**king miserable.

6. **The honeymoon or infatuation phase will last approx 1–6 months**. The longer it last, the more likely it is you’re in a toxic relationship with many “highs and lows.” Exciting, right? Can be, but will drain your soul over time.

7. **They are a lot of work, no, I mean a lot of work**. There will be disagreements, arguments, control issues, insecurities, and a whole other slew of issues. It’s how they are handled while having your partners best interest as well as your own and not getting lost in the process that will determine the fate of the relationship.

8. **Build a friendship first and take things extremely slow**. People are so quick to jump in the sack and start the relationship intensity out at a 10, when it should gradually start and build to 10. Very few if any relationships make it to the 8–10 range and maintain it.

9. **Don't relationship “hop.”** You aren’t chasing your next perfect partner, you are escaping yourself chasing relationships. If you can’t be alone, you will never find a partner that will fill the empty inside of you. But you will find a partner to keep your well dry.

10. **In all honesty, you never really know someone**. You think you may, but you don’t. Be completely 100% independent and happy with yourself and your life and your chances greatly increase of finding someone on the same path.

11. **If you are toxic, you will finding a matching partner who is just as toxic or more so than you**. While this whirlwind romance will be intense and fun at times, it is very damaging. And if not corrected within yourself, you will keep repeating the toxic relationships with new partners.
