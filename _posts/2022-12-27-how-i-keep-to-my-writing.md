> Creativity exists on a spectrum. Some of us are visionaries, some of us are technical masters.

It is often interesting and amazing how anyone can produce their thoughts from empty sheet of paper, and often these days, a blank screen to something that can resonate well with others.

This can often involve of mental gymnastics. Sometimes difficult to come by the right words or expression to portray your exact thoughts.

Throughout the years, we are conditioned to do things well and to constantly improve. If we are not doing that, we're led to believe we're getting worse. If we regress, we are failures. These beliefs are all based on a flawed assumption: that progress is linear.

At an extreme, this could lead us to chase perfection. If something is absolutely perfect, we believe it's not worth doing. But perfectionism creates an impossible standard for us to meet.  
This is just one of many reasons we start procrastinationg and get blocked.
