I am always here,  
A constant presence, near or far.  
If I am away, it is to seek  
New knowledge and experience. 

I journey far and wide,  
Exploring the world and all it holds.  
I am driven by a thirst for growth,  
A desire to learn and be bold. 

But even when I am away,  
I am always here in spirit.  
For I carry my knowledge and experiences  
Wherever I may go, and I share them. 

I am an educator, a creator,  
A guide on this journey of life.  
I am always here, ready to inspire  
And help others reach for the sky.
