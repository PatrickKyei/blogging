In life we don't always get what we want. Our most pressing needs are not always met, our deepest desires are not satisfied. But we are not fixed to take a single path in our lives. If things don't turn out the way you expect, look to other alternatives that will serve you the value you want. Like the common saying is, "When one door closes, another opens."

Are we going to cry behind doors about disappointments? No. From today, we are going to drive the boat where we want it to go. If your current job is not serving you well, improve yourself and apply for a higher position or switch to a different career.

If your current relationship is been toxic to your growth, opt out and have the freedom to sour higher. Don't let your life end when things don't go well because you can paint another picture; the one you want to see.
