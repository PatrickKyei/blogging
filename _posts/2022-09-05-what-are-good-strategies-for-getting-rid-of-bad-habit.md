Making a change in your mindset (the way you think) — and closely connected to that, making a change in the way you talk to yourself.

This is where all change begins.

Let me explain what I mean.

The bad habit you’re trying to stop could be going on for years, and most likely you have tried to end it on several occasions. But every time that happened — maybe two days later, or two weeks later — you’ve concluded it’s impossible.

You told yourself, “I can’t stop doing this!”

Instead of the same negative self-talk over and over, you can choose a different path and say, “Why not TRY to stop it?”

Every time you ask this type of open-ended question, you are creating a small shift in the way you think — your mindset. Actually, you’re switching from fixed to a growth mindset way of thinking. As Carol Dweck describes in her book [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/0345472322), your mindset does not need to stay fixed over the course of your life.

A fixed mindset makes you believe that your personality, skills, and strengths are “fixed” i.e. you have them from birth and there’s nothing you can do to change them, for better or worse. If you’re the type of person who smokes, there’s no use trying to stop.

Or, if you believe you’re a quitter who leaves one job after another or goes from one relationship to the next, there’s no point in changing your ways.

That’s a losing way to lead your life, don’t you think? Believe it or not, you can cultivate a growth mindset in a number of ways: you can change your attitude and core beliefs about yourself, other people, even different angles for solving a problem.

Here’s a real-life situation where you can practice getting rid of your bad habit.

Next time you hear that inner voice telling you I can’t, I’m not capable of stopping, remind yourself that it’s your fixed mindset talking. Give yourself permission to react differently by taking these steps:

## 1. Give yourself some time to think if there’s something hiding behind your “I can't!”

Maybe it’s the fear of not being able to do something successfully, or not knowing how to stay away from things you know aren’t good for you, or feeling OK to stay in your comfort zone, or not having enough self-discipline to get out of it.

## 2. Ask yourself why you are feeling so much resistance

Be honest. What are the thoughts and feelings you’re experiencing right now? Is there fear of any kind, a need to distract yourself because you’re avoiding something, or is there some other benefit you believe you’re getting by keeping the bad habit? Find out what it is so you can do something about it.

## 3. Think how a habit change can benefit you

You can win over the fear that’s been following you for a long time. You can lead a healthier life. You can reach a goal that matters to you by getting all obstacles out of the way. Not to mention how great you’ll feel once you put the bad habit behind you!

## 4. Ask the question, Why not try to stop it?

Then observe how your brain reacts to the question. What is the first thing that comes to mind? Do you immediately look for obstacles if you try something different, do the words give you courage to act differently, do you feel you have more freedom to contemplate what a positive outcome will bring you?

## 5. Consider the future for a minute or two

What would your life be like if you decided not to let fear limit you? How would you deal with other obstacles if you kept an open mind about this one? By adopting a growth mindset, you can cultivate strengths and skills through continued effort over time. This mindset can give you the strength to say no to bad habits, starting with this one — right now.
