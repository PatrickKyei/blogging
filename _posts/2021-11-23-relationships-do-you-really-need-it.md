You can ask yourself a really important question that some people never ask themselves.

Invest in great relationships - I'm not talking about finding a partner or a spouse. What I mean is developing meaningful connections with friends, colleagues, mentors, bosses, peers and anyone really that you like and admire.
> All of the research shows that the quality of our relationships determines most of the happiness in our lives.
Having strong friendships to fall back on, that's a great way to create opportunities in life for yourself. So if I were you I'd be actively working on meeting new people and taking a chance on sharing yourself with them.

And I'd also consider deepening the relationships you already have with your parents, siblings, old friends and whoever it is because investing in those relationships will also be a big part of really living in your thirties. I wouldn't fix it on getting married or finding a spouse or anything like that. Just focus on the people in front of you and see where those relationships take you.

At the same time start exploring something that you care about. I'm not just talking about you throwing yourself into your career. If this aligns with your career great, but that can come later. I'm talking about finding something that really lights you up. It could be an issue and activity a puzzle a problem a sport a goal a craft a game anything really.  So just to put it, literally play around, explore, find that thing and then take tiny steps towards it every day. Forget the bigger picture, forget making money. Just follow your curiosity for now. If you do this consistently it will slowly nudge you towards your "purpose" - you know I know that word's overused but this is really what it means here. But honestly doing something you really care about it, doesn't even need to become something that profound. It can just be fun, it can just be interesting.

I'm actually a big fan of starting small here. Small is okay. Also invest in yourself, read a ton, share what you learn with the people you know. Maybe even with a few people you don't know yet. Apply what you learn to new situations and new problems.

Become a real nerd about one or two things that you care about. Also this one's obvious but it's crucial, take care of yourself. Eat well, exercise regularly. This will work wonders for anxiety and depression. I know you've heard it before it'll also make the rest of your life so much better honestly. I'd make this a top five priority no matter what, it is a game changer.

And face difficult situations in your life headson. Get into more existential questions like, "what should my life be about and what is it all mean and what do I do with all these feelings I have about my past and my purpose'. Find someone good. Somebody who gets you and challenges you and start talking. And finally I would try to go on some adventures. A lot of what I am doing and plan to do more of is to travel around and get a ton of new experiences. Getting new experiences light me up of course but it also exposed me to new ways of thinking, living, eating etc that helped me grow really quickly. I grew up quickly and I got a ton of life experience in a much shorter time than my peers and it helped me be kind of ahead of the game. And a lot of ways this might help you make up for some loss time as well without actually taking a decade to do it.

So go get it buddy, I know you might be a little late to the party but that does not matter. You are at the party and you are still so young. You have plenty of time to live your life, so good luck.
