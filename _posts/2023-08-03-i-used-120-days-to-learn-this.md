### The Decision That Turned Everything Around

In June 2022 I parked a few things in my backpack and embarked on a journey to a place I have never lived. A place I had no relative or someone I could call a friend.

I left a stable job and embraced the opportunity to start something from scratch and learn a lot from this process. But it didn't come easy. It had it's own up and downs.

### You Can Start All Over Again

One of the most important things that struck me was that I could start my life all over again if I needed to.

### Your Basic Needs First Over Anything

No matter how much we have amass for ourselves, our daily bread and a place to lay our heads is what we need to keep us going.

What I sought out first when I settled down was how I could get water, where I can get foodstuff if I needed to cook and the things I'd need to prepare food. Any other thing was secondary.

Though men may value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in time of famine they willingly barterr them for bread.

Abraham Maslow theory of needs cuts across every experience of our lives. Our basic human needs are water, food and shelter if we have life.
