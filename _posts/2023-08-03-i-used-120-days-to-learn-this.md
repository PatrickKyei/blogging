Depending on your experience this may sound familiar or unfamiliar to you.

In 2022 a pursued a project in completely new environment and lifestyle. Far from what I was accustomed to.

> I spent 120 days away from everthing I know and I am familiar with, this is what I learnt.

### The Decision That Turned Everything Around

In June 2022 I parked a few things in my backpack and embarked on a journey to a place I have never lived. A place I had no relative or someone I could call a friend.

I left a stable job and embraced the opportunity to start something from scratch and learn a lot from this process. But it didn't come easy. It had it's own up and downs.

### You Can Start All Over Again

One of the most important things that struck me was that I could start my life all over again if I needed to. 

> I hope you live a life you are proud of. And if you find that you are not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.

### Your Basic Needs First Over Anything

No matter how much we have amass for ourselves, our daily bread and a place to lay our heads is what we need to keep us going.

What I sought out first when I settled down was how I could get water, where I can get foodstuff if I needed to cook and the things I'd need to prepare food. Any other thing was secondary.

> We must be thankful that what is most needful and useful, generally is most cheap and common.

Though men may value very highly their gold and silver, and the luxuries which are counted the best fruits of every land, yet in time of famine they willingly barterr them for bread.

Abraham Maslow theory of needs cuts across every experience of our lives. Our basic human needs are water, food and shelter if we have life.

### Don't Downplay Relationships And Your Support Network

The saying that your network is your networth is true in all dimensions. 

One of the people I immediately established a friendship with was my barber. At least I saw him once every 15 days and that means if I needed any information about the community I could go to him.

He was actually a nice guy to have a chat with. Many times he had stories about the town to share. And he made my boring days a bit cheerful. I would just visit his shop on weekends and I was not busy to go chat. Sometimes I went with movies he had requested me to download for him. We watched the Transformers Age of the Beast, John Wick 4, Cocaine Bear etc.


### Asking For Help Is Strength

It This was a completely new environment for me. Which means that there were many things I needed someone to help me with which included getting access to certain information I didn't have.

It's true, sometimes it's difficult to approach a stranger and ask for their help even though we need it badly. The interesting thing is that a lot of people are ready and happy to help us if only we ask.
