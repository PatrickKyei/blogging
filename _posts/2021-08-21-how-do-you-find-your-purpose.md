### How do I find my Purpose or Passion?

This is one of the most common questions that is asked by both the old and the young. And I never liked this question. Because asking it implies that we are supposed to find something magical and it also implies that we haven't found it yet and thus somehow failed in life as a result. A lot of other people too try to tackle this question usually in exchange for a hefty cash. So let's go on a deep dive and try to demystify this mystery.

### The thin line between Purpose and Meaning

How do you find your purpose when so much of life is not purposeful? When you go through periods of life when you are not in touch with your purpose, when your sense of meaning goes in and out. How are we supposed to figure out "what we are meant to do" when life is not always built in with purpose and meaning?

People really often get a hung on this. They often say something like, "I don't really have my purpose", "I haven't found my true calling". And questions like these are dangerous because it sort of says that whatever you are doing now is garbage and a waste of your time because you are not on purpose - you haven't found your calling. And that to me is dangerous because it sort of feels like until you find this magical thing, you've been a failure.

Now there is this occult of purpose that the world has created. And the cult of purpose says that you must have a very clearly defined external purpose in order to be happy, fulfilled, successful, grounded etc, and that purpose has to become your professional work. But if your job is not aligned one hundred percent with this deep rooted purpose; if it doesn't give you supreme meaning then you are doing something wrong. And I think that is a really misguided and totally not exciting fun way of going about the most important question we are going to ask ourselves as humans. It's great if you can find a job that fits your purpose of course, but for most of us life doesn't work that way. Finding your purpose is not that easy. It's confusing and it's random. And yet there are certain principles and things we can do to find our way to authentic meaning and purpose in our lives. And that starts from separating these two things.

### Purpose and Meaning

We often use these terms interchangeably. But when people talk about finding their purpose I think they are usually talking about feeling a sense of meaning.

And **meaning** is about finding our life significance, finding our lives worthwhile, interesting, exciting, challenging in the right ways. **Purpose** at the simplest level is the way we explore that significance. So to find your purpose is to discover an activity or role, or sets of actions or projects and goals or even relationships that help you access that deeper sense of meaning and expand them.

So we can say that meaning is the What and purpose is he How. And as human beings we are wired for that sense of meaning. That is part of our make-up. There is really no way around finding meaning; the reason why it is such a difficult and absorbing topic for many of us is that we all want it so badly. *And one of the primary reasons this has become such a problem is that we all think it is going to come from work.*

But if you talk to someone who is raising three kids or a mom, I don't think they are going to say that their life is meaningless. But we think unless we are doing this hobby as a job, we have failed. A lot of people feel that a person who is grinding away at their so called “purpose” that is part of their professional identity is more meaningful or purpose driven than a mom who derives a ton of meaning from raising her children. But these two things are equally meaningful to those two people. It all comes down to what they value and build their lives around.

The important thing to understand is that we do have this inbuilt drive to find, explore and expand meaning. Our purpose, which is to try to discover this meaning; and when those two things line up life becomes a lot more interesting. So simply, meaning is finding our life significance in general. And purpose is essentially the way we try to find that meaning. And I think it is important to keep it as simple as that because it doesn't need to be any complicated, otherwise we will not find it.

### The Reason People Seek Purpose in Life

Having a purpose gives us an anchor in life and a kind of protection against some of the more difficult aspect of life [Viktor Frank](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Frankl) professor of psychology said, "Those who have a why to live can bear with almost any how".

And it is also an important thing to remember that it isn't just feeling excited, it goes beyond about how we navigate life. It can therefore be put as, meaning is the What and purpose is how we get to the what.

### The Truth About Meaning

The truth is that meaning is deeply personal. It is different for every single person and it changes during the course of your life. There is been too many occult of purpose and this is what we should be able to identify and break away from. Some of the way this gets sold is

* One: You've got to have a purpose to be happy. If you don't you've failed.
* And two: it has to be your job. You can't just have hobbies and enjoy your family.

So we've been exposed to this influence online that we somehow have to make dressing and standing in front of classic cars something to define success. And this is not healthy. Because it causes you to veer way off from what your purpose might be. And it leads you to make bad decisions. At  the end of the day meaning generally comes from a handful of common sources.

### Where We Can Derive Meaning From

One of the biggest is relationships. That can be a romantic or love relationship, it could be a platonic relationship, it could friendships both close or far away, it could be family and it could be professional relationships. That is like a one huge bucket of meaning and all of us to some degree derive some meaning from that.

Another big one is beauty. Which I think includes art, nature and any connection we have to what we find interesting or stimulating out in the world.

And another one is suffering, which is a weird thing to say we can derive meaning from this very painful experience. But the thing is suffering is actually a very interesting teacher. Not always immediately useful and definitely not something we would want to sign up for. But how many people have gone through incredible difficult circumstances only to discover that it is what gave them so much? You can get a lot. Whether they went through a breakup or they lost their job or they lost a love one.

Another one is of course service and generosity. And that comes down to giving, helping, adding value to people's lives. That can be in a professional or personal way. There's volunteer work, there's pitching your network, there's making connection among your friends, there's all different ways to be generous. But service is the big one.

And the last big bucket is kind of achievement and growth - ambition, goals, betterment, self growth. And these are all profound ways to find out how much we can grow and learn in life, which is a big source of meaning. The reason why we are talking about this is that these are the foundational sources of meaning that they might underline every kind of purpose you can ever imagine. You can explore all those sources of meaning in different kind of ways. For example to explore the meaning of Arts, you can be a painter or sculpture. You can be a teacher, you can be a critic, you can be a musician or you can be an archaeologist. These are all different purposes but they are accessing the same source of meaning.

So purpose is variable and you can even argue it is probably infinite. But the deep sources of meaning are fixed. Let's keep these in our minds as we move through these principles because at the end of the day I think you are going to find out meaning can only come from a handful of places but it's really up to us to figure out among the thousand possibilities what our purpose really is.

So to simplify everything we've been talking about so far: when you are struggling to find your purpose, put on pause for a moment this obsession to find this idea, the headline that is "This is my purpose" and start looking for the meaning behind it. And it doesn't mean you necessarily know what your larger purpose is. But when you have a connection to the fundamental meaning, then all different kinds of work can actually become quite purposeful.

It's a lot easier to follow meaning and let meaning show you "what your purpose is" as you follow it than just try to pick a purpose and reverse engineer the meaning.

### Then How Do I Find Meaning?

The natural next question is, "Then how do I find the meaning."

But here's the thing, and again I really believe that it's important to make this super simple because when it gets complicated then it is not useful and probably wrong.

We are meaning making machines. We are wired to find and experience meaning. I would say that eighty percent of this journey is paying attention to what is automatically meaningful in the day to day of our lives. You could be one hundred percent lost in the bigger picture and still have an intuitive grasp of what you find significant.

There's a really important thing to note. Meaning doesn't just help us navigate from situation to situation hopefully to get us closer and closer to our purpose, sometimes it helps us to discover the purpose within the place we are already in that we were missing because we weren't connected to the underlying meaning.

### The Bending Curves

So it is important to also note that you should be willing to be lost. And a lot of us aren't. I get it, uncertainty sucks. But this journey is ongoing, it is dynamic and lifelong process and if you are afraid to be lost ever, you are going to have a harder time finding your purpose. Because we love expecting to be on purpose one hundred percent all of the time; our life should feel purposeful all of the time. This is just not unnecessary but also actually impossible.

I think anyone who has found their purpose has gone through periods of uncertainty and confusion and deep self doubt. And the weird thing is that people don't want to talk about that because it is not very interesting and once you are on the other side of it you forget how scary it really was.

*There's a journey that is not entirely logical and that is very very difficult. But if you keep paying attention to what you find meaningful and you keep expanding that, then those periods of uncertainty and self doubt will turn out to be the roads to your purpose almost every time.*
