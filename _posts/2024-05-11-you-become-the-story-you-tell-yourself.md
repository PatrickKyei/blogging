Life makes sense through a series of stories presented to your awareness.

The information, ideologies, concepts and symbols that are exposed to your awareness becomes your story.

This is how you make meaning of the world. 

Each story is built on top of the other. A layer on top of another layer.

Everything you know is just a layer of stories pieced together for your understanding. 

Your mind makes sense and gives meaning to life through the series of stories you get exposed to. 

### YOUR PERSPECTIVE IS SHAPED BY YOUR REALITY

Your identity is shaped by the stories you tell yourself. If you are conscious about it. Or the story you are told to believe, if you are unconscious about it. 

From the day you were born your reality has been shaped up until now ( if you have not broken out of the cycle to pursue your own goals.) by parents, friends, teachers etc.

You had to learn to navigate the world through the series of stories you were told.

 - You were taught what a hand was.
 - You were taught what a leg was. 
 - You were taught what body part you use to walk. 

> Crazy to think about it, who knows how you'd learn to walk had you not been told to use your legs.

As you grew up your parents told you what a cup was, and what it was used for. They told you the earth was round and the clouds live beyond the skies.

These stories continue up to where you are told if you have to be happy you have to:
- go to college
- get good grades
- find a decent job
- retire at 60 and wait for death

So your life has become an imitation of society. The stories passed to your parents passed down to you.

That is exactly what humans do. They imitate for survival. 

We imitated our parents, teachers, and friends in order to learn how to function in the world. 

Without much awareness many stop there. 

Intelligent imitation comes after the fact. You learn from those that are condensing information you are curious about, dissect it, understand it, and experience it. How? 

Through self experimentation.

Experiments = experience.

If you don’t choose your own goals, society will choose for you. 

If you don’t choose your own values, society will choose for you.

If you don’t choose your own beliefs, society will choose for you.

### SHAPE YOUR PERSPECTIVE - EXPERIMENTATION

Life itself is an ongoing experiment.

Experimentation allows you to develop your own personal philosophies — guiding principles that shape how you approach life and how you interact with the world around you. These philosophies aren't handed to you; they're forged through your own experiences, insights, and reflections.

Experimentation is how you form your life philosophy. It is how you set your own goals and remove the limiting beliefs society set for you.

Without self experimentation, you go through life on autopilot. 
Like robots on an assembly line. Doing what you have been programmed to do without question.

### PURSUE YOUR OWN GOALS

Since childhood I have been very curious about what lies beyond the average life. I was interested to understand if there was an alternative path aside the average one I see everyone take which is often dictated by society.

From observation, it is not hard to see that those who find fulfillment in anything they are doing are those who have carved their own paths and are pursuing their own goals.

Pure bliss is experienced when you do what you love. You are immersed into whatever you do because then you have an end goal in mind that fuels your decisions and actions.

You have been able to break through the conditioning of the mind and are in control of your conscious thinking. You see life for what it is. A series of experiments until you find meaning.

Those who have the freedom of thinking and unlimited mental potential pursue their own goals. They pursue personal projects they find meaning in or can attach a sense of worth.

And they do it consciously.

True fulfillment comes as a result of altering your state of consciousness. From a controlled mind to an independent mind.

The only way to achieve that is by entering a state of optimal experience.

Because your default state of mind is characterized by complete disorder, self-doubt, fear and jealousy.

Consciousness creates order, making all of that self critique and mental chatter disappear.

You experience heightened attention, loss of self and your information processing speeds up.

Your path to mastery shortens, enabling you to cultivate any skill much faster.

To achieve optimal experience you need to pursue your own goals not the ones society has set for you.

Pursue meaningful project(s) that will become your life's work. 

Life becomes more meaningful when you can connect everyday thoughts, experiences, information, and stimuli to a project.

Struggle becomes meaningful because you know the end game.

This is a completely different experience if you are working a job.  
A job can bring you a sense of meaning but it is fleeting.

You are essentially pursuing someone's goal and you are uncertain when they would remove you from their life's work.

Your actual job is to explore the unknown and make new discoveries by researching the crevice of reality that you feel the most compelled to. This is where you should draw your own meaning from and not by pursuing another person's goals.

Set your goals before you become an NPC. 

Life is a game. And every game has a story. An end game. 

What would be your story? Will your story be the story of the player, in control, or the character who does what he is programmed to do.

### UNBOX YOUR MIND

Because of your mental conditioning you have limited yourself to only one path to what you want to achieve - the end goal which is your happiness. To work a job and wait on a salary at the end of the month until you go on retirement.

People are not that industrious because they fear risk. The average salary worker fears risk so he prefers to wait for the month to end so that he can receive his salary, pay the bills, take the children to school. 

Don't you have more potential than that? 

Stop waiting on the government.

Stop waiting for your parents.

Stop waiting for your uncles.

Stop waiting.

Take your destiny into your hands.

Early on in my career I had friends and family project their idea of a safe path to me. Some suggested I go to college to earn a teaching degree. Others wanted me to enter the police service.

80% of living the life you want boils down to creating your own goals while most people are mindless slaves to society’s goals. 

Goals change how you interpret situations, which influences your actions, which programs your identity, which compounds over years into the good life. 

You can’t solve a problem unless you’re aware of it. 

You can’t become aware of a problem unless it impacts a goal. 

Most people don’t have goals. Most people are afraid to make mistakes. Most people don’t give themselves a chance to improve any aspect of their life. 

### START A BUSINESS

Business is where you pursue your own goals by solving a problem.

Problems are everywhere and you have the skills and knowledge to solve them.

You are a business. The one person business. If you are working at a job, you are a business in a bigger business. The fundamental function of a business is to solve people's problems.

If you solve problems at your job or solve your own problems you are qualified to start a business.

Business is about solving problems. 

I have heard some people say business is not for everyone and I just think that is sheer gate keeping. 

Everyone is built for it if you strip away the business label and processes. It's just solving problems for a living like we did before the industrial revolution.

Here's how to start. 

 - You do a 9-5 job and that means you have a skill.
 - If you don't have a skill you can go online right now and start learning, and implement what you learn to gain some skills.
 - Solve a problem
 - Share the solution
 - Sell the implementation

 Start talking about the services you can offer.

Start posting content that shows that you know your onions in the industry you find yourself; finance, health, education, agriculture, etc.

If you can create at least 10 quality post every single day for 2 weeks, it will be impossible for people to ignore you!

Use my [Social Media Writing Simplified](https://nas.io/skillembassy/tusf) as your launchpad

I know doctors and teachers who are into the Consulting business by just leveraging the internet and putting themselves out there.

If you are in the finance industry start doing simple accounting services for people virtually. 

Create posts that tell the world you are available for accounting services.
Market it shamelessly, give discounts. 

Before you know it you're overbooked. You employ others. You make your millions.

I can go on and on.

BUILD A BUSINESS ONLINE!

It is stupid to have a million dollar dream and let someone with a 10k salary talk you out of your goals.

Do not shrink your ambitions to make other people feel comfortable around you. Excuse yourself from such environment. 

Go pitch your tent with folks who dream big, talk big and do big.

If you don't choose a struggle you'll be assigned one.

If you don't choose the thing you want to suffer for, a goal or purpose then you're going to be assigned one either way and that's usually going to be a lot more difficult.

You're going to be assigned a job, you're going to be assigned a life path, you're going to be assigned what to learn.

If you don't make every decision or work to make every decision in your life conscious and intentional and by your own doing overtime, over a lot of time, then you're going to fall into the trap of everyone else.

You can see that most people are working towards goals that are not their own.

That were projected onto them by their parents or their friends or whatever.  
They're doing everything to fit in and conform, when that obviously leads to getting the same results as everyone else and getting the same results as everyone else is not fun. 

Like you can just look around and see that it's not fun. 


### CACHE YOUR MIND

Your phone or computer starts to run slow, you clear cache to get it running more efficiently.

To make the most of everything you have read up until now, you need to be conscious of what, and who you are imitating.

Imitation is embedded in our microbiology as part of human survival.

If you are exposing yourself to a person, what is their message? 

Are they promoting negativity and limiting beliefs that you will adopt? Or are they promoting growth, education, and showing you how to move in a positive life direction? 

What is their hierarchy of goals and does it align with yours?

You've already got something trapped inside your mind that you are working to undo.

Something that suffocates your dreams and you are hoping it dies.

Then someone you are looking up to keeps awakening those limiting beliefs.

Then BOOM it comes up out of nowhere like an evil surprise.
Hovers over you to tell you millions of lies.

The point I'm making is, the mind is a powerful place.
And what you feed it can affect you in a powerful way.

Just think about it for a second.

If you look at your face every day when you get up and think you'll never be great, You'll never be great, not because you're not, but because of the condition you have passed your mind through.

It will always find a way to cut you up and murder your faith.

Your attention is going somewhere, might as well fuel what you believe in (and what you want to become). Stay conscious. Don't put yourself in a box.

Thank you for reading and have a wonderful week.
