You know, everyone makes mistakes sometimes, and that's okay! It's a normal part of being human. Imagine you're playing with a stove, and you accidentally touch it when it's hot. Ouch! It hurts, right? Well, the good thing is that you learned from that mistake. Now you know that touching the hot stove can hurt you, so you won't do it again.

Just like how you learned from touching the hot stove, when we make mistakes, we try to understand why it happened. This helps us avoid making the same mistake in the future. It's like when you learned not to touch the stove because it hurts. Learning from our mistakes helps us grow and be safer. So, it's okay to make mistakes sometimes, as long as we learn from them and try not to repeat them. 

Remember, making mistakes is a part of learning and growing, and it's all a normal and important part of being human. So, don't worry too much about making mistakes. Stop burning yourself in regret from your past experiences and rather keep yourself burning because of repeated mistakes. Just try your best, learn from them, and keep growing smarter and safer every day! You're doing great! ðŸ˜Š
