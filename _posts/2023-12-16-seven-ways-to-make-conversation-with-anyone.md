Talking to new people might seem like a lot of work, but I've got some easy tricks to help you out. 

You see, strangers can bring awesome opportunities. 

Each person brings a new experience, an opportunity to learn something new, experience something different, or hear a story you've never heard before. 

Imagine you're in a room, and you spot someone you want to talk to. You feel the first word on your lips, but it's stuck somewhere in your throat. You are shy. Don't worry, just say it!

**Start with a Simple Hello**

Imagine the first word as a gate. 

Once you open it with a simple greeting like "hi" or "hello," everything else flows more smoothly. 

Put on a big smile and say hi! Don't hesitate. 

If you are reading this by that person stick your hand out, and say hello.

Forget the boring "hi, how are you" routine.

It's a time waster. Instead, ask a personal question. 

People love sharing, trust me! 

Instead of asking what's up, try something unique like: How did you get that interesting tatoo? Or, do you remember the first day you came to this city? 

Personal questions lead to cool stories.

Answers to those questions are always something unique, always something personal. 

Make an effort to find the one thing that you and that other person might have in common. 

When you start at that point and then move outward from there, you will find that all of a sudden the conversation becomes a lot easier and that's because both of you are suddenly on the same side of something. 

Starting with something in common is like having a secret handshake. It instantly makes conversations easier. Maybe you both like the same band, are from the same place, or share a love for the same soccer team. 

Finding that "me too" moment is like finding a treasure.

Make people feel great by saying something special. Skip the usual words like nice, awesome, or cool. Be unique. 

Try saying something like, "I love how your smile makes your whole face light up!" You'll be memorable for sure.

Everyone has an opinion. So ask about something simple, like their favorite coffee or the last movie they watched. Listen carefully to what they say. It's like playing catch with ideas.

All of us have opinions trust me. But we all want them to be heard and everybody wants validation so go on and ask for an opinion.

It opens up a two way street, that's when the real communication begins and you will be surprised how much you can pick up about a person just by asking their opinion on something pretty generic.

When you talk to someone, be all there. No multitasking. Look them in the eyes, and they'll know you're really listening. Eye contact is like a magic spell for connection.

Remember the little details about a person.
When you meet someone, remember their name.

It's like a secret code to their heart. And don't forget other stuff they tell you. It shows you care. You could even ask about their pets or remember their favorite places.
