> The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. —Michio Kaku

I spend most of my time around computers and I am fascinated by the amount of power they have.

A whole company the size of New York city can be run and managed by a single computer connected to the cloud.

If your brain, your mind is the powerhouse of your productivity why haven't taken absolute control of it?

With the advent of the internet and social media, your brain is always connected to massive pool of information.

But instead of leveraging your access to the internet to nourish your mind, power your brain for it to run your life efficiently, you spend your time just scrolling online to numb your mind.

You must keep your mind in regular active activities that improves your overall life.

Computers undergo regular software updates to run efficiently. The same thing can be said about the human brain.

> "You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength " - Marcus Aurelius

#### Seek knowledge that improves life

You need proper information to think properly and to think as a human. Or you will behave at the basic instinct or superstition level. 
Work on your mind. 
  
 - If your life sucks try educate yourself.  
- If you feel you are not making any progress educate yourself.  
- If your mind is clogged and your perspective  
looks blurred educate yourself.  
- If you feel a limit on your mental ability and  
creative potent educate yourself.
- The right mindset makes everything right. 

There's something about knowledge. 

Once you continue to get knowledge you will never fail. You will see that you are making progress without even being aware.

Years ago I got fed up with the progress I was making. So I decided to go on months of self improvement journey.

I didn't know exactly what I was doing but I love being challenged.

I spent hours upon hours to learn new skills and build lots of projects.

At first everything felt like a bunch of disconnected nonsense. But I kept on. I sat there, in front of my laptop - reading and building different kinds of projects with the intention to launch some of the them into businesses.

I wasn't successful and I failed at a lot of them. As painful as it was, this experience taught me some of the biggest lessons that I live by even today. 

I have a wealth of experience and practical case studies I can apply to my online businesses today.

___On that note I want to let you that we are opening a small window of beta users for [the Value Creator Module](https://nas.io/skillembassy/challenges/content-writing-challenge) of Skillembassy Digital Mastery Bootcamp in a challenge which starts on 21 July.___

If you continue to 
 - feed your mind
 - purge your mind
 - renew your mind
 - polish your thoughts

improve yourself because knowledge is what builds your inner being, you'll begin to operate on a higher frequency.

Your emotions are weak because you have a weak mindset. 

Once you have strong knowledge your emotions will improve. 

You'll have power over the resources that you are wasting.

You'll have control over the decisions that you have to make to change your life. 

You will be shocked how your overall life will improve.



### 8 Truths to Build mental mastery

#### 1. Seek new information

When you buy a new computer it comes clean with only the basic software you need to access the computer interface. 

All the important software you need to work with is downloaded and customized by the user to their preference.

When you are born you don't know anything. You are as clean as a new computer with the basic senses to navigate the world.

Your parents, friends, teachers and society download into your brain new softwares which shapes your identity. 

You are told to go school, get a job and retire Early in your 60's.

So chances are the actions you take will be made according to the information that you were exposed to. The beliefs that have been programmed into your mental software.

The people around you and the things that you've been consuming are not going to make any progress in your life if you hold on to those beliefs. 

In fact they'll be detrimental to your progress. 

So what you want to do is read vastly. [Consume content and information that will challenge your beliefs and expose you to new ways of thinking.](https://nas.io/skillembassy/products/kpsv)

Most of your problems stem from mental limitations and blockages.  
  
If you want to master all areas of life, mental mastery must be at the top of your list.  
  
How do you do that?  
  
self-awareness,  
self-examination,  
self-determination.  
  
Where do you start from? Self-education.  
  
How do you start? Read books.


#### 2. Discover your true self


You cannot discover who you are without friction.

You need limits to find yourself.

You discover who you are when you push through pain, doubt, the exhaustion of life—this is where you discover what you are made of. 

Gold is tested with burning furnace. Without friction, the push and the pull, you cannot get anything fine.

Challenges strip away the excess, the noise, the excuses. They force you to confront your raw, unfiltered self.

When you face your limits, you confront your fears, your weaknesses, and your insecurities.

In that moment , you find clarity, strength, and a deeper understanding of who you are.

When you reach the pinnacle, cross the finish line you'll appreciate who you have become. 


Your resilience, your grit, your unyielding spirit will stick with you for life.

#### To sum up:

You need to hunt for new information to challenge your worldview.

Your perspective shapes your reality.

I will stamp this quote here so that you keep it at the back on your mind:

“Knowing is not enough, we must apply. Willing is not enough, we must do."  
  
Taking in so much information into your mind without applying it to build a personal project will cause mental obesity.  
  
It clogs your mind and shallow your creative potential.  
  
↓  
Read to learn.  
Build to apply.  
Distribute to expand.  
  
Learn  
Build  
Expand  
  
Knowledge and willpower are important.  
  
Invest in a personal project and build a project that reflects your life's work.
