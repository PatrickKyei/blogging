How are you preparing for the key events in your life, the things that are important to you?

Are you merely wasting your time, or are you genuinely using the time you have to prepare for the life you want to live?

To me, life is like an arena or a practice field.

You believe you know everything there is to know and are unwilling to use your time wisely when you have the opportunity.

What we must realize is that life as a whole is a process. The time we have is like that cold, beautiful breeze that we never get back once we miss it.

There are no refunds for unused time. I chose to live my life as though the next moment may be my last, so time is not mine. If you behave as if the next thing is going to kill you and then practice it again and over until we can beat that thing, we know how to cope with it, and you do a lot better job at every chance that comes your way.

When you're young, you believe you have a lot of time, but the fact is that we don't. It's frightening, and you should be.

People should have a sense of urgency about their time, in my opinion, since having a sense of urgency keeps you alert and allows you to make crucial decisions quickly.

You understand what I mean? Living in fear of the amount of time you have left gives you a feeling of purpose.

I believe that sometimes people become too comfortable, and when they do, they lose their sense of urgency because they simply feel like, "Oh, I'm OK. I'll put my feet up. I can just glide through this thing called life and accomplish what has to be done at any given time."

Something is amiss when you reach the point where you are no longer afraid and less concerned the time you have left on this earth.
