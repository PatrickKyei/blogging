- Everything begins with how you perceive yourself. Consider yourself worthy. Feel unique. Feel as if you are deserving of the best in life. Those who appear to have it all are no different than you. You can also feel different if you believe you are deserving of the best.

- Spend no more than 5 minutes worrying about something that will not matter in 5 years. No amount of adversity can destroy you. Worry about what’s gonna happen in the 5 years that matter.

- The same chemicals in the brain (neurotransmitters) that cause happiness and joy—dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins—can be deliberately used to increase positivity. The good news is that the brain is unconcerned about whether you are happy or sad. It only responds to stimuli that cause it to be happy or sad, and it starts responding immediately by releasing the corresponding chemicals.

- Tough times do not come to destroy you; rather, they come to bring out your best qualities. When things get tough, don't just focus on survival or ways to get out; otherwise, you'll miss the big picture. Open your mind and look for opportunities.

- Even when all doors are locked, there is always a way out. Don't give up hope. Continue looking. Continue your search. Continue to knock. Somebody will arrive on the scene who is impacted by the constant noise of your knockings.

- Tough times don't last, but tough people do. How will you know if you're tough unless you've been put through the ringer? Diamonds cannot be formed unless they are subjected to pressure and heat.

- Even the most terrible events can be overcome by maintaining a positive mental attitude. Even the hardest man or woman will be broken by negativity. When it comes to the battle of thought vs. matter, the mind always prevails.

- Hope cuts through despair like a candlelight shining through darkness, or a laser cutting through metal, or a hot knife cutting through butter. No amount of darkness, no matter how intense, can extinguish the candlelight. History is littered with hopeful men and women who overcome immense difficulties, as well as desperate men and women who gave up hope.

- The will to live is stronger than the most difficult circumstances. If you're desperate and on the edge of giving up, the best method to keep going is to find a worthwhile reason to live. Find a good reason to live for the sake of others.

- Staying active is the best way to keep positive during difficult circumstances. Simply take action. Take action. Don't be passive; do something. Use your creativity. Imagine yourself at a track field and jog around your cell if you're in prison. If you're in a lockdown, get some exercise. Consider yourself in a gym. Strike the air. Never let oneself get stagnant. Maintain your concentration. Before and after each exercise session, take a deep breath in and out.

- Create a morning, afternoon, and nighttime routine. Allowing yourself to get stagnant is a bad idea. Make sure you're always growing. Life's ups and downs are inevitable, so don't let them hold you back.

- Don't turn a molehill into a mountain. What you are afraid of will never happen. The majority of your fears are merely your imagination. What you concentrate on the most expands in your thoughts. And what you focus on less becomes smaller.

- Finally, staying connected to someone who is positive and close to you is the best way to stay positive during difficult circumstances. Two persons are preferable to one. Even better are three. Don't die yet if you don't have anyone. Someone has already been sent to you with your name in mind.
