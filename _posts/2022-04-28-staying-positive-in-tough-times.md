Life has a history of throwing us into challenging situations. Those circumstances can appear to be out of our control at times. What can we do to keep our cool as we consider the best course of action in those situations?

- Everything begins with how you perceive yourself. Consider yourself worthy. Feel as if you are deserving of the best in life. In stressful circumstances, feeling undeserving can steal your joy. It will make your problem appear to be larger than you or any feasible solution. Those who appear to have it all are no different than you. You can also feel different if you believe you are deserving of the best.

- Spend no more than 5 minutes worrying about something that will not matter in 5 years. No amount of adversity can destroy you. Instead of worrying about what you can't control, shift your energy to what you can create.

- Tough times do not come to destroy you; rather, they come to bring out your best qualities. When things get tough, **don't just** focus on survival or ways to get out; otherwise, you'll miss the big picture. Open your mind and look for opportunities. Allow hard times to be your greatest teachers. Get the lesson out of them.

- Even when all doors are closed, there is always a way out. Don't give up hope. Continue looking. Continue your search. Continue to knock. Somebody will arrive on the scene who is impacted by the constant noise of your knockings.

- Tough times don't last, but tough people do. How will you know if you're tough unless you've been put through the ringer? Diamonds cannot be formed unless they are subjected to pressure and heat. Don't easily give in to the magnitude of the situation. Every lock has it's key. Keep searching.

- Even the most terrible events can be overcome by maintaining a positive mental attitude. Even the hardest man or woman will be broken by negativity. When it comes to the battle of thought vs. matter, the mind always prevails. Your mind has tremendous power. Your life will begin to change once you fill it with positive thoughts.

- Hope cuts through despair like a candlelight shining through darkness, or a laser cutting through metal, or a hot knife cutting through butter. No amount of darkness, no matter how intense, can extinguish the candlelight. Look forward with hope, not backwards with regret.

- The will to live is stronger than the most difficult circumstances. If you're desperate and on the edge of giving up, the best method to keep going is to find a worthwhile reason to live. Find a good reason to live for the sake of others.

- Staying active is the best way to keep positive during difficult circumstances. Simply take action. Don't be passive; do something. Use your creativity. Maintain your concentration. Don't be a passive observer whiles you wallow in the deepshit of the situation. Life's ups and downs are inevitable, so don't let them hold you back.

- Don't turn a molehill into a mountain. What you are afraid of will never happen. The majority of your fears are merely your imagination. What you concentrate on the most expands in your thoughts. And what you focus on less becomes smaller.

- Finally, staying connected to someone who is positive and close to you is the best way to stay positive during difficult circumstances. Two persons are preferable to one. Even better are three. Don't die yet if you don't have anyone. Someone has already been sent to you with your name in mind.
