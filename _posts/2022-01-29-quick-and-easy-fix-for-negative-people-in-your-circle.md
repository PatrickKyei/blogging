## Negativity

> Scientifically happiness can be a choice. 

We have the choice to be happy in our life. And after you've made that decision, it turns out to be a huge advantage in terms of our relationships, since positive people are viewed as more beautiful by the other sex. 

In social circumstances, they are seen to be more trustworthy. They are more likely to receive loyal clients who purchase from them in the trade business. We discovered that they are really more likely to live longer lives. It turns out that when individuals make that choice, the influence extends not just to them, but also to everyone around them, leading them to be happy as well.

> Happy is contagious. 

Mirror neurons are found in the human brain. We just recently identified them in the human brain, but basically, if you see someone yawn and then other individuals in the room start yawning, that is your mirror neuron acting on your brain, which physically appears. There's a biological explanation behind this. When you watch individuals around you yawn or grin, specific regions of your brain light up. As a result, they light up and demonstrate activity in your brain, indicating you that you're the one yawning and smiling. You may also detect the weariness of someone sitting across the room.

You may genuinely pick up on other people's bad moods.


The research discovered that if you have 15 strangers waiting for a plane and they have no idea they're part of an experiment and you have an undercover researcher come near them and just act anxious; they tap their foot on the floor, move side to side, look at their watch repeatedly with a frown on their face and within two minutes, we found that seven to twelve of the 15 individuals were unconsciously moving nervously in place.

Which demonstrates that the reason for that experiment and why I'm telling you about these mirror neurons is because emotional contagion has a biological basis. That even if you are a really positive person, you might take up on the negativity of others around you, much like secondhand smoke. Because it's not only smiles and yawns that spread, but it turns out that if you're surrounded by individuals who are always focused on the negative, nervous, or depressed, even if you're an optimist, you'll pick up on it.
 
When you inform others about this, they instantly begin to eliminate toxic people from their life. But I believe that this research is far more powerful for you and the people reading this because it shows that when we choose to become more positive, when we create a positive habit in our lives and buffer ourselves against the negative, we can actually seamlessly change the brains of those around us, causing them to become more positive and outdoing the negative effect.

> So the true question is, can we train ourselves to be optimistic enough to overcome the negative forces that surround us?

Instead than needing to quickly remove negative people from our lives, we can actually grow stronger than them by implementing some of these good changes and developing these great habits in our lives.

Based on this research, I believe a much better technique would be to carefully pick who we pass around or allow into our social space.

But it implies that a third of the individuals an optimist is talking to, there's a third of a chance — I mean, a third of a chance — that the person they're talking to who doesn't seem particularly happy is actually an optimist but isn't expressing it right now. The more individuals who choose to be verbally and nonverbally expressive of their optimism at work, the more the social script changes, allowing those 31% to feel that they can be more hopeful. And so they don't have to keep moaning or complaining.

But that means that a third of the people that, that optimist is talking to, there's a third of a chance — I mean, 30 percent chance that the person they're talking to that doesn't seem very positive is actually an optimist but is not being expressive of it right now. The more people that choose to be verbally and non-verbally expressive of their optimism at work, it changes the social script, allowing, unlocking those 31 percent to actually feel like they can be more optimistic. And that they don't have to keep going along with the grumbling or the complaining.
