> Scientifically happiness can be a choice.

## Positivity effect

We have the choice to be happy in our lives.

After you've made that decision to be happy and stay positive in your life, it turns out to be a huge advantage in terms of our relationships, since positive people are viewed as more attractive by the other sex.

In social circumstances people who exhibit a level of positive energy are seen to be more trustworthy. They are more likely to receive loyal clients who buy from them in the trade business. We discovered that they are really more likely to live longer lives.

It turns out that when people make that choice, the influence extends not just to them, but also to everyone around them, leading them to be happy as well.

> happiness is contagious.

Mirror neurons are found in the human brain. We just recently identified them in the human brain, but basically, if you see someone yawn and then other individuals in the room start yawning, that is your mirror neuron acting on your brain. There's a biological explanation behind this.

You may watch the research on the effects of the brain mirror neurons on the human brain.

When you watch people around you yawn or grin, specific regions of your brain light up. As a result, they light up and demonstrate activity in your brain, indicating you that you're the one yawning and smiling. You may also pick up on the stress of someone sitting across the room.

You may genuinely pick up on other people's bad moods.

## Research

The research discovered that if you have 15 strangers waiting for a plane and they have no idea they're part of an experiment and you have an undercover researcher come near them and just act anxious; they tap their foot on the floor, move side to side, look at their watch repeatedly with a frown on their face and within two minutes, we found that seven to twelve of the 15 individuals were unconsciously moving nervously in place.

Which demonstrates that emotional contagion has a biological basis. That even if you are a really positive person, you might take up on the negativity of others around you, much like anything else. Because it's not only smiles and yawns that spread, but it turns out that if you're surrounded by individuals who are always focused on the negative, nervous, or depressed, even if you're an optimist, you'll pick up on it.

When you inform others about this, they instantly begin to eliminate toxic people from their life. But I believe that this research is far more powerful for you and the people reading this because it shows that when we choose to become more positive, when we create a positive habit in our lives and buffer ourselves against the negative, we can actually seamlessly change the brains of those around us, causing them to become more positive and outdoing the negative effect.

> So the true question is, can we train ourselves to be optimistic enough to overcome the negative forces that surround us?

Instead than needing to quickly remove negative people from our lives, we can actually grow stronger than them by implementing some of these good changes and developing these great habits in our lives.

Based on this research, I believe a much better technique would be to carefully pick who we pass around or allow into our social space.

## Key TakeAways

- I've got a win win proposition for you today. I'm gonna make you more persuasive, I'm gonna make you happier and I'm gonna start a social movement in your heart in a tiny little way that's gonna make you take actions towards your relationships and the kind of people you keep in your circle today.

- You have to make sure you are surrounded by people who exhibit positive energy and have positive influence.

- Keep people who bring your energy down at arm's length. Because these stains that other people have on their own emotions, they do rub off on those associated with them. Keep people like that in arms length.

- You don't have to snub them or pretend that they don't exist. You can still help them if it is not over you. But just keep them at arm's length
