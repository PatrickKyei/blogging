Many times we grow up to believe certain things and consider them as facts without investigating the truth in them. We slouch about thinking about them deeper because we think many people believe the same thing.

In the same way, there are some misconceptions about relationships that have been generalized as the truth. But if you think about them carefully, you will find out there are not the truth and that there are other interpretations for them.

You can grow up to be a well educated person and yet without the facts in them if you have not asked or thought deeper about them.

## Misconception 1: Networks are inherently self serving

Many people falsely think that being in a relationship is more about what they will gain from it than what they can contribute. Any relationship you enter with this preconception is guaranteed to fail.

When you advise people to expand their network during networking events, what they immediately think to do is look for people who can meet their needs.

Networking is a two-way path. You must invest in something as you receive it. Relationships are everything, so as you continue to grow your network, give priority to those who reciprocate your investment.

Keep a handful of meaningful relationships.

## Misconception 2: Our strong ties are the most valuable

It may be true that our relationships with family and friends are the most dependable. However, there are occasions when the uncommon contacts in our network turn out to be quite valuable connections.

Let's consider starting or running a business. The majority of the people who will patronize our business in its early phases are those whom we once met at a party, business meeting, or church or mosque. Your second stage clients are your immediate family members. The folks you occasionally speak with are your real clients.

The people you say hello or hi to only when you come online. 

## Misconception 3: Relationships should form naturally

If you don't make a conscious attempt to get to know someone, even if you cross paths with them more than once, things will still be the same.

You may create the value you want if you consciously consider making an investment in your relationships.

Our thinking is that a person does instantly become your friend after saying hello to them - No.

If you put in the effort, friendship and any other type of relationship work.
