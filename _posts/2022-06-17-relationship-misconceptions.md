Many times we grow up to believe certain things and consider them as facts without investigating the truth in them. We slouch about thinking about them deeper because we think many people believe the same thing.

In the same way, there are some misconceptions about relationships that have been generalized as the truth. But if you think about them carefully, you will find out there are not the truth and that there are other interpretations for them.

You can grow up to be a well educated person and yet without the facts in them if you have not asked or thought deeper about them.

People sometimes think that being in a relationship is only about what they will get out of it more than what they can also offer. If you go into any kind of relationship with this notion, it is doomed to fail. 

Anytime you tell people to increase the scope of their network, what comes into their heads is to look out for people who can meet their needs. 

## Misconception 2: Our strong ties are the most valuable

## Misconception 3: Relationships should form naturally
