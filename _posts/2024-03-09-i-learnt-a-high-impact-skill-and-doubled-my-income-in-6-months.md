7 years ago, I was a broke guy with 0 followers and 0 career opportunities.

I spent 6 months online behind my computer to learn high impact skills and build an online presence. 

2 years later, I’ve made a huge trajectory, I've had the opportunity to work with well known companies both home and abroad just by putting myself out there. 

How?

By mastering the art of building a digital resume.

Nothing is more powerful in the digital era.

Companies hire based on your online portfolio.  
Companies hire individuals with influence to push their brand forward.

We were all here when we saw Khaby Lame rise to the top to win  international deals and awards. What did he do and what did he use?

Social media.  


Most of the time, what we do on social media is to consume information without creating. 

If you want to win the social media game, become a creator. Instead of just consuming, consume to create. With the right amount of following and quality content, you can monetize your account. Even better you can convert your followers to costumers when you have a product or service you want to sell. 

Facebook pays creators.  
X, formerly Twitter, pays creators.  
YouTube pays creators.  
Instagram pays creators.  
Tiktok pays creators.   
Telegram is following suit.  

Additionally there are different ways to generate income through affiliate marketing, product unboxing, paid advertising, brand ambassadorial deals etc

It is not hard to see that we are in the creator economy.

7 years ago it started as:  
 - No skill.  
 - Directionless.  
 - 100ghc spent on data bundle every month.  

Then I joined the digital space and life changed.  

Today I:  
 - Own a startup.  
 - Giving others skills.  
 - Can monetize anything.  

This is how life changes.

1 decision!

You can create a career for yourself by doing just what you love doing.

This is the power of having a strong online or digital presence. 

It is the reason Elon musk posts on Twitter everyday.

Otherwise why would a big time entrepreneur and owner of billion dollar businesses be doing on social media? 

The secret lies in building a online presence.

A unique personal brand.

Grow your audience.  
Drive recruiters attentions.  
Productize your skills.  

Learning to build expand your network, grow thousands of followers on online, and create long-form digital assets like free courses, newsletters, podcasts, and YouTube videos that make you stand out from everyone else.
 
Crafting and developing a digital resume is your way to attracting life-changing opportunities, creating a life of freedom, and building a creative career that becomes the vessel for your life’s work.

I can say this with 100% confidence because it’s what I’ve experienced.

It’s my mission to help others create their dream lives and become magnets for life-changing opportunities by learning a high impact skill and leveraging the Internet and social media.

Learn a high impact skill, build a business and expand your impact. 

I'm hosting a paid training soon, to teach more about how you can:

- learn a high impact skill in 6 months ( design, coding, writing, video editing etc),  
- leverage social media to build an audience,  
- craft a value offer & convert your audience to customers.  
- build a one person business with any high impact skill.

It is not sufficient to learn.

It is not sufficient to consume information.

Build a small project that solves a problem.

Build a business.

Expose yourself to the world of freedom.   
If you want to be productive, you have to have a goal in mind. 

There is a big difference between being productive and being busy, but sometimes that line gets blurred. 

Having dedicated focus is the only true way to be able to measure productivity.

Extreme success is not the result of numerous small actions or productivity hacks. 

It often boils down to a few key decisions or ideas that have a significant impact. Identifying and executing on these impactful decisions is crucial.

You have the opportunity and choice every day to shape your future. 

Refocus your attention on the past; focus on the present.

Do one thing everyday that will tilt the needle towards your future. 

It's never too late to start.

Hope this helps.

Talk soon.
