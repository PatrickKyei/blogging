Society is a behavior system.

This is something I recognized just by studying the people around me.

Everybody usually ends up at the same place. 
This was a very interesting observation. After many years I came back to find out that the people who were high above the chain are stuck in the same place.

Stuck in bad relationships.  
Stuck in unfulfilling jobs.  
Stuck with poor health.

> "Humanity is conditioned to follow a default path in life that is set out by society. The 99% of people that do what they're told question nothing and pass down what they know. This leads to a population that can't think for themselves, to a dull, mechanical and mindless life." - dan koe

Your family, teachers and even the people you look up to will tell you to do the same thing that ended them in the same place - nowhere. 

Society, all of the societal and cultural information that your parents learned were passed down to them by their parents and then passed down to you and future generations.

Societal information and all of the news and whatever that was circulating in the pasts were passed down to the children and then to you. 

And the cycle goes on as you are learning how to operate within the world that you are living in right now. 

What blows my mind is that this could be completely different. 

When you expose yourself to new information and change.
Expose yourself to a renewal of mind and life.

The point is that this default roadmap society hands to you send you like a train hurling down the tracks. 

And if you don't learn to take your own path, then you may be heading towards a dead end. 

Many people are on the assembly line. Waiting to take off and land when society says so. A life on autopilot is a life half-lived.

The societal script might have a beginning, middle, and end, but it lacks the most critical element: you.

If there was no government, would we have any choice except be self governed? 

If there were no corps, would we have any choice except to figure out the right way to live? 

If there was no knowledge, would we have any choice except to be curious? 

If there were no teachers, would we have any choice except to be our own teacher? 

And if society had done it's job properly, the world  
wouldn't be facing pandemics, wars, climate change,  
famines, droughts, floods and wildfires, unemployment,  
extreme inequalities, racism, colonialism, apartheid.

We overestimate external authority, and underestimate our own intelligence.

So if 95 plus percent of society is just on the assembly line, doing what they're told, following the path that was laid out in front of them by society, then the majority of people that are the masses are leading us off the cliff into a ditch. 

That 95% is a lot of people, right? 

Copy paste is a great keyboard feature, and almost always a terrible way to build a great life.

It is what it is. But we can work to change that through conscious self education. 

Too many people are going through life without any sense of who they truly are or what they want.

This can go far enough that we even stop recognizing ourselves. We lose touch with who we really are.

It is obvious to see today that those controlling society kept the truth from us  so that they can control human behavior. 

They have done everything to be gatekeepers of information and  the truth.

With the decentralization of information, you have access to a massive database to feed your mind on the right type of information to alter the direction of your life.

Think about it, there's so much wisdom out there especially with the internet and all of the content we have access to.

The internet has created flexible approach to work. The new age of remote work.

There are new career paths. That instead of having about 50 limited jobs where you will be trained into a doctor, teacher, lawyer, pilot etc there has been an insane increase in the number of careers you can fit into.

Which means that you don't have to try to fit yourself into a job with preset boundaries.

Where for example if you are a nurse you have to work a certain number of hours,   
Become a pilot you need to learn specific skills,   
And if you are a teacher you have a defined role.

The internet has allowed anybody to follow their curiosity, pursue mastery and at the end of that there is a career that is perfectly suited to you.

You are able to develop a career path that fits your lifestyle perfectly.
You are directly in control of when you want to work, where you want to work and how much income you receive for the number of hours you put in the work.

But how do you actually do this?   
How do you find a career path that pays you incredibly well and lets you do what you love well?

The secret is to embrace the change, drown yourself in self education and pursue your life's work. 

Which is no secret at all. Except I want it to sound like the golden nugget so that you will be pushed to take action that will completely change your life. 

Because change often seems hard even when we know it is good for a better life.

Change is like jumping off a cliff and building your parachute on the way down. 

I like doing hard stuff.

Not that I look for trouble or I don't want an easy life. Who doesn't?

For me, the fastest way I have experienced massive growth is when I throw myself into the abyss.

Learn, fail, iterate, fail, learn, win. 

I have learned so much from experience and personal development.

Self improvement is underrated. 

If you are scared to break a few things and explore unknown territories you will never grow. 

A man is great not because he hasn't failed. A man is great because failure hasn't stopped him. 

A lot of people are stuck in life because of following a predefined path in life.

If you are not renewing yourself, you are falling behind. 

Every day should feel a bit scary, because you are constantly challenging yourself with new experiences that cannot be overcome by the current you.

Take advantage of the space that is available to you. The internet space is available to anyone who has a smartphone that can access  the internet which includes you.

I have a few questions for you:

Are you giving your best with what you have, or are you waiting to have 'enough' before taking action?

If you can't afford premium apps, have you made the most of the free resources available to you?

With a busy schedule as a student, parent, or full-time employee, what are you doing with the little 1-2 hours you have? Netflix or productivity?

Many productivity apps have free versions. How are you using them?

You might not have money for courses or masterclasses, but have you explored YouTube, Google, AI tools, free journals, etc.?

If you make good use of the free resources, you might eventually afford premium experiences.

If you keep misusing the little you have, even when you luckily get enough, you will still not make the most of it. 

The internet is the best thing to happen to this generation and you don't have any excuse to be ignorant or unequipped.

Ask yourself: Am I doing my best with what I have right now?   

If 'No', you know what to do.
