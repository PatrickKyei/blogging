## What Is Ego?

Simply put it, [*ego*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-concept) is a person's sense of self-esteem or self-importance.

Our ego is responsible for reality testing and a sense of personal identity.

### The Alter Ego At Display

Sometimes when you look at celebrities and high performers that you look up to, they are like superheroes of some sort. They act and behave in a *superhuman way*you find impressive. But when you meet these people in life, they are surprisingly normal people. They are friendly people who do the normal stuff we are all used to doing. And you may often ask yourself how these people are able to do that. How are they able to transform from one identity to the other? And more importantly, how do we harness this for ourselves?

This is what can be termed as the **Alter Ego Effect**

Continue to scroll down as we answer some of these more interesting and fascinating questions.

### The Alter Ego Effect

Now this alter ego effect we are talking about here is different from been or acting fake. It is not just about thinking and choosing the version of you that you want to present. That's not quite what the alter ego thing is about.

An alter ego in it's root form comes from Cicero, a Roman Philosopher, who coined the word **"The other I or trusted friend"**in 44BC. And that's a really useful idea for people to keep in mind. Because when you think of how many people operate in their own heads, it's sometimes like the merry-go-round effect of constant bullying by telling yourself you can't do things you want to wish you can do; and you are more like judging yourself. And this is where the alter ego steps in those areas where we are really trying to perform and bring the best self out there and access that trusted friend in us. So in our heads it's really healthy to understand that there's a duality that we all exist inside of.

Human beings are fantastically nuance and our greatest superpower is our creative imagination. That's what separate us from everything else that is here. Our ability to create worlds in our heads, to tell ourselves stories, to suspend this belief of what we can or cannot do. And so alter ego is simply leveraging the superpower that we already have to help us go and do the difficult things.

### We Live In Context

We are extraordinarily layered and it is important to understand that we live in context in life. Who you are when you are home is of course going to slightly be different from who you are when you are at social gatherings. Or when you are on the sports field or in front of the church singing. So we all have element of our personality show up highlighted different in these layers. And so when you are building alter ego for yourself it is in context with who and what you are bringing on that field to help you succeed. Because maybe the elements of the current way you are operating are getting in the way of that success.

We don't know everything about everybody anyway. So everyone's love for each other is in the context of what I already know about you. If I share something personal with you, you will be like, "Holy crap, didn't see that coming, I thought that guy had it all figured out or something like that." We are not using this alter ego or trusted friend to help go and impress other people, it is literally acting upon the natural intrinsic motivators that are inside people to go out there to grow, learn and explore more of ourselves, seek adventure, curiosity to see what we can do.

I intellectually understand that the version that people are interacting with me is not a complete version. Of course it is not! It is impossible! They are not in my home when I am with my parents or siblings. So people shouldn't be overly concerned that the alter ego self is the version that people are falling in love with.

### Pretending To Be Someone I Wanted To Be

Cary Grant the famous Hollywood actor had this famous quote before he passed away; *"Pretending to be somebody I wanted to be and I finally became that person or he became me or we met at some point."*It is very useful for people to think that way because if you think about your current self as a two circle Venn diagram; there is where you are right now and what you think you can do, and there is this version of that vision of how you want to be living. And that creates a gap. And maybe you have the hardest time thinking that you can go and do that right now. So an alter ego becomes that bridge. It's like thinking maybe I can't do that but super *Patrick or John* can help do that. Because what you are doing now, is you are suspending your narrative and you are now stepping into someone or something else's narrative to help you get there. Now you might ask, "which one is you?" "What if I do so much great work with super *Patrick or John* and then people love that, but then regular *Patrick or John* still feels like a turd?"

Now this reveals how you are thinking about other people. If you are always going to be in the mindset of thinking of other people, that will always keep you trapped. The results are going to be extraordinary high levels of stress and anxiety if your motivations are for how other people are thinking of you or your motivations are for only winning the medal or winning the race. All an alter ego is doing is helping you to develop yourself, it's just that you are doing it on your own terms. Because you are been very intentional about who and what you are trying to go bring out there; not so you can impress other people; so that you can actually get the results you were looking for, that you know you have the capability for.

Nothing is more frustrating for people than when they put their heads on the pillow at night and they say to themselves, "Why didn't I say xyz that day" or "Why didn't I raise my hands and speak up or why didn't I say this when I had the chance" or "When that person looked like they will be a perfect client for me, why didn't I close the deal". That makes people feel trapped. Right, because the real you that knows you can do that didn't act up in that moment or didn't speak up. Well an alter ego will be a vehicle for people to do it. And it is not a weird idea; this is not strange at all. Because every single reader, reading this right now has one hundred percent at some time used this idea. It's part of the human psyche; it's part of the human condition. There's no denying it; no one has ever said they haven't used this. Because when you were a child you pretended to be your favorite rock-star or your favorite sports-star or you pretended to be superman or a cowboy or a nurse or a teacher when you were playing. We naturally do that, and we are doing that at a very young age because that is when we are at our most creative. That is when we are using the most of our imagination and all of a sudden, people start to tell you to grow up. Or at your age stop been childish and we internalize that as oh the things I did at six and seven, I need to shed that and I need to start acting more serious if I go out.

And so this isn't about acting childish right now, there is a big difference between acting childish and childlike.

If there is a mission to what we are discussing right now, it is to help you realize that your creative imagination is truly the thing that will help set you free or get you where you want to go, with a lot more grace and a lot less friction. And so this idea of been childlike and tapping into an alter ego isn't something new. This is like for me a great remembering for people.

### Living In Context

People need to start living more in context. When I go home I don't bring confidence, articulate and decisive dad to my kids, that's not who they want; that's not helpful. Instead I bring a playful, fun and gentle self.

So the alter ego first of all is more than one. The alter ego is a version of who we are deep down. Because even with people who are easily angered, they are not born angry kids. So the alter ego uses the natural self. And what is the natural self? That is what we are all trying to get back to; is to figure that thing out.

In the world of performance the number one thing we should learn to do is subtraction. We should learn how to delete and remove. You know if you are trying to climb to the top of a mountain, people who get to the top the slowest are the ones who want to take everything with them. All of their trauma, all of their past hurts, all of their judgments or whatever. Anyone who tries to pack a lot of stuff on them doesn't get there; it's slow. The highest performing people are constantly removing. And what an alter ego helps you to do is compartmentalize things.

So you stepping into Wolvering or Black Panther or Wonder Woman or any character you are inspired by to get things easily done moves around resistance with formal grace so you can get yourself out there.

### The Torn Down Belief

One of the core theories of Psychology that's been torn down in the last few years is the idea of the human who identifies himself as the single healthy self. It was deemed as the most mentally healthy. That was always a key core principle in Psychology but fundamentally proven to be untrue now. They've actually abandon that idea. And actually people who see themselves as the single self in all environments are people with typically high rate of mental issues. People who identifies and understand that they have multiple selves are extremely healthy mentally. Because we live now on that field that, "this is my work self, this is my home self."

### Takeaways

The first impression I want to make on you is that you already know how to do this, you did as a kid. But how we do this is always in context. Where are you building this alter ego for? Like what is the place that is maybe frustrating you the most; where you want to get the biggest win right now.

In one of our previous readings, we got to know that the best leaders are those who present their character according to how the situation demands. A good leader doesn't work with only one style of leading his people. This is actually what the alter ego promotes.

That goes further to teach us that to win more people to our side and grow our network we need to treat people the way they want. And that is often not easy. But if we wear this alter ego self this can become more easier to do.
