Read the first part of this [Letter here.](https://patrickkyei.com/posts/build-whatever-you-want-build-mental-mastery/)

This a second part of a 2 part series.

Unto our conversation from last week:

> Your mind is a supercomputer and your attention is the RAM. Thoughts, regrets and tasks are the program slowing your performance. Learn, build, expand to focus your mind.

If you do not improve your mind, you cannot improve your life.

To change your life, first what controls your actions and behaviors.

There are quite a few things we have mentioned already. 

Read on to discover the rest.

#### 3. Seek mentors

We are no longer limited by geographical boundaries when it comes to connecting and keeping in touch with people around us and even those on different continents.

Change starts from the mind.  
  
If you believe you can't do something you will never be able to do it.  
  
However, if someone showed you how it's possible because they did it, you are set free from that mental prison.

So what you want to do is find online mentors.

My progress significantly boosted when I found the right online mentor to guide and push me when the motivation oil evaporates.

People that introduce you to new ways of thinking and new ways of seeing life are so important.

First, they tell you what to do but second of all the main benefit is you now know what not to do. 

So much effort and energy is wasted in the beginning by questioning yourself.

"Am I doing the right thing?", "should I do this or should I do that", "should I do it in this way or should I do it in that way". 

A Mentor helps you 'focus' and that can completely change the game.

#### 4. Solve your own problems

Yes we mentioned a Mentor. It is important to have a Mentor. However a Mentor is not going to solve your problems for you.

They may be able to give you a roadmap that will help you. The actual responsibility is on you. Your life is your responsibility.

Gain actual experience by solving your own problems. Hit limits. Learn. Push through.

You need challenges to find your limits.  
You need limits to find yourself.

We set goals to knock problems off in our lives.

So identify a goal in your life. Like quitting  your job, finding a partner or getting fit.

Start with what you know. You can only know what to learn when you hit a roadblock. 

So hit one fast and pursue your curiosity. Let your experience guide you into new areas of your life to experiment.

#### 5. Prove yourself to yourself

Prove yourself to yourself.

Nobody cares about you.  
No one believes anything you have to say until you prove that your words have weight.

Work hard to give life to your words.  
Actualize your words and become reliable.

Proving yourself to yourself improves your mind and builds your mental mastery.

When you prove yourself to yourself, you gain:

- **Confidence:** Knowing you can follow through on your promises builds self-assurance.
- **Respect:** People respect those who back up their words with actions.
- **Reliability:** Becoming someone who delivers on commitments makes you a dependable force.

Don't rely on outside validation. Show yourself what you’re capable of. Once you see it, others will see it.

Master your mind, and you’ll master your world.

#### 6. Ditch friends who slow down your progress

For the past 5 years I have managed to tighten my circle of friends.

I have identified certain people I don't want them in my circle of friends. I stayed off their tracks.

I am not saying treat people poorly. It would be good for you to keep certain people at arms length and help them when you can.

Limiting beliefs are contagious. If you hold them, it’s often because those around you do as well. 

Society today restricts your potential by overly socializing you. Constantly engaging with others’ opinions—whether on your phone, social media, or in person—leaves little time for solitude. However, as Naval Ravikant said, “Greatness is built in solitude.” 

To become truly exceptional, you need space, solitude, and loneliness foster discipline and mastery. 

Success demands obsessive focus, which is hindered by frequent social engagements and distractions.

#### 7. Invest in yourself

You suck.

The reason you aren't getting results in your business, the reason you aren't making money online, the reason you aren't making headway in your relationships is because you suck.

You aren't good enough. You haven't put in the thousands of hours of improvement necessary to get good enough.

On a global scale, there is a lot of quantity. You can't stand out by making stuff; you stand out by making great stuff.

Here's the truth:

- You're not putting in the work.
- You're not improving daily.
- You're not learning from your mistakes.

Quantity is everywhere. Quality is rare.

To stand out, you need to:

- Commit to relentless improvement.
- Invest thousands of hours to master your craft.
- Focus on creating great work, not just more work.

Stop making excuses. Start putting in the effort.

Greatness is built over time. It's earned through dedication and hard work.

You have the potential. Now, put in the hours to make it happen.
#### 8. Collaborate

You can get anything done if you do not care who gets the credit.

- Mastermind
- Network
- Ask for help
- Get a mentor
- Model someone who is where you aspire to be

Collaborate!

A simple piece of advice can:

- Build you a huge audience
- Launch your product
- Make you millions
- Change your life forever

Stop worrying about who gets the glory. Focus on getting things done. Share the spotlight, learn from others, and watch your success skyrocket.

I hope this helps. Have a great weekend.
