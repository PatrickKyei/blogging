Increase practice to decrease time for results.

I have completed courses in less than 3 months where others will take 6 months.

I have launched an online business in less than 4 months where others will take years.

I have built and maintained lifetime connections in few weeks where others will take months.

There's a little secret framework to getting things done.
It's pretty simple so people overlook it and think they need some crazy approach to get things done.

If you want results, be consistent in executing this three-step framework:
 - learn  
 - build  
 - expand  

If you want to learn, read a book  
If you want to build, start a project   
If you want to expand, contribute to collective knowledge  

Let me break it down.

### 1. LEARN

If you spend just half an hour each day, consistently, for half a year
that's 180 hours of focused effort.  
Now, multiply that by 12 months, and you're looking at a whopping 360 hours.

Now what could you do with all that time?

learn a new language  
master a musical instrument   
become a coding wiz  
write a book   
start a business   
or even get in the best shape of your life.

While most people are binge-watching TV shows, scrolling endlessly through social media, or simply wasting time, you're investing in yourself and your future.

4 years ago I was learning back to back. 

Every day after work the first thing I would do is boot the computer. 

I would spend most of my time taking design, coding, and marketing courses.

Do one or two shallow projects.  
And then I would continue until I was satisfied with the outcome.  
The internet was my classroom. 

Learning never exhausts the mind.

Learning is the foundation of the human experience. 
Be in a constant state of learning to acquire new perspectives to shape your worldview.

Every single idea in your head was either observed or learned by something external to you. 

If you stop learning life stay the same and you get bored. Hunt for ideas.

Read books  
Listen to podcasts  
Watch YouTube tutorials  
Buy a course

I trick myself into reading when I don't have the strong urge to:  
I tell myself I’m only going to read for 60 seconds.

Easy enough right?

After starting, by default I want to make more progress.  
So I end up reading for 30 minutes, an hour or for hours instead of 60 seconds.

Multiply your knowledge bank.
Improving your mind daily is the only addiction you’ll ever need.
You don’t need more time. You need less distractions.

Quit your excuses and read for 5-minutes.

You can't self-develop without making learning a habit. 

Meaningful work includes 3 things:

 - Curiosity: learning what you care about
 - Mastery: improving what you care about
 - Purpose: working on what you care about

Consistent effort adds up faster than you might think. 

While others are standing still, you're moving forward, one small step at a time.

### 2. BUILD

Learning must be done coherently with building.

Mental obesity is when you learn without using the information to solve a problem sitting in your head.

If you keep learning without taking action,  
You won't see results.

If you keep taking action without learning,  
You'll work harder but might not get better results.  
You need them both to succeed at whatever you do. 

Keep learning  
Keep taking action

And it'll only be a matter of time before you achieve the results you desire.

You don't need a lot to make it work.
Learn the minimum skills you need and then Build.
You'll learn everything else along the way.

### 3. EXPAND

You grow when you contribute to the collective knowledge.

Those who give value receive value.

If you aren't happy with how much you make, it may be time to take a brutally honest look at what you contribute to the world.

The world runs on value exchange. 

Your products, services, or ideas are your contribution to the world.

Create value by sharing what you know.

When you contribute to the collective knowledge—whether it's by writing, teaching, or sharing insights—you're not just helping others, you're also growing yourself.

The more you give the more you receive.  
This is not some fluffy concept; it's a fundamental truth of life.

Do some self reflection.  
Ask yourself: What am I contributing to the world? Am I sharing my knowledge, my skills, my talents in a way that adds value to others?   
And if not, what can I do differently?

When you focus on giving—on truly making a difference in the lives of others—that's when opportunities start to flow, and your impact starts to ripple out into the world.

Hope this helps.  
Talk soon.
