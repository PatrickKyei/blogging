## Own your reality, not someone else’s

I'm a really big believer in looking at things the way they really are and I'm not gonna lie to you, you are gonna be confused by life many times. You are going to try and compare your life with others, or people will try to influence you to live the kind of life they live. You have to find your path, your way of doing things that really work for you. If we listen to the voices against who we want to be, we may never settle.

## Cut all toxic people out of your life

No matter how lonely you get on your journey, do not reinvite toxic people back into your life. Engaging with toxic people will drain your motivation, passion, purpose and meaning of life. 

## Get in some form of exercise 30 mins a day

Now there is a universal knowledge about the importance of PE. From basic school to Uni we were thought how good exercise can for your physical body. And sometimes not just your body, you need it to clear your mind. Get a gymn membership, or make it a happen to jog, take a stroll, do yoga or engage in your own aetobic exercise in your house periodically. Keep your body and mind under a good condition.

## Learn how to calm yourself in tough situations

We are all likely to face some form of difficult situation in our lives and how we comport ourselves will speak volume about how we will deal with other people. 

## Stop procrastinating

THE PROBLEM IS YOU KEEP SAYING YOU'LL START FROM TOMORROW BUT IF YOU WANTED IT BAD YOU'D START FROM NOW. Set goals, build habits, pursue your goals and you will make history.

## Find a job you love, not one that just pays the bills

The for humanity (service) and the love for a product(solution), when these two collide the urge to wake up every morning to work is always new. Fall in love with what you do because of what you can do to people. Love for service and love for a solution; that's what brings out the passion.

## We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on that

## Rid yourself of negative self talk

 Own who you are and what you want for yourself. Stop downplaying the things you care about, the hopes you have. Own your passions, your thoughts, your perceptions. Own your fire. Own saying no, saying yes. Own your mood, your feelings. Own your plans, your path, your success. Almost every successful person begins with two beliefs: the future can be better than the present, and I have the power to make it so.

## Surround yourself with like minded people

A lot of things also come down to identity, right? Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity as possible if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible. Therefore 

## Get outside at least 20 mins a day

Creativity is sparked by adventure. 

## Read on a topic that interest you that you don’t know much about

## If you have the time and resources get a pet

## Drastically reduce your time on social media



## Quit comparing yourself to others

## If you are in a toxic, abusive relationship, leave

## Starting changing slowly, take baby steps. Slow but steady progress

## Quit trying to find love, do the above and love will find you

The goose chase for love is crazy and never ending.
