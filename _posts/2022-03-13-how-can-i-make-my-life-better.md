## Own your reality, not the reality of others

I'm a firm believer in seeing things as they truly are, and I'm not going to lie to you: you're going to be confused by life at times. You'll attempt to compare your life to others', or people will try to persuade you to live the way they do. You must find your own route, your own method of doing things that works for you. If we listen to the voices that contradict who we want to be, we may never be able to settle.

## Cut all toxic people out of your life

Do not welcome toxic people back into your life, no matter how lonely you get on your path. Engaging with toxic people saps your motivation, passion, purpose, and sense of meaning in life.

## Get in some form of exercise 30 mins a day

There is now widespread agreement on the value of physical activity. From elementary school to university, we were taught the importance of exercise. And sometimes you don't just need it for your body; you also need it to cleanse your thoughts. Get a gym membership, or make it a habit to jog, walk, perform yoga, or conduct your own aerobic exercise at home on a regular basis. Maintain the health of your body and mind.

## Learn how to calm yourself in tough situations

We are all likely to face some form of difficult situation in our lives and how we comport ourselves will speak volume about how we will deal with other people. 

## Stop procrastinating

The thing is that you keep saying you'll start from tomorrow, but if you really wanted it, you'd start now. Set goals, form habits, and pursue them, and you will make history.



## Find a job you love, not one that just pays the bills

When the love for mankind (service) and the passion for a product (solution) combine, the desire to get up every morning to work is always fresh. Love what you do because of what you can accomplish for people. Love for service and love for a solution; that's what brings out the passion.

## We are mediocre at many things, find one thing you are GREAT at and “double down” on that

## Rid yourself of negative self talk

Take charge of who you are and what you want for yourself. Stop downplaying what you care about and your hopes. Take control of your desires, ideas, and perceptions. Own your fire.Own your no-saying and yes-saying. Take charge of your emotions and mood. Take charge of your plans, your path, and your success. Almost every successful person begins with two convictions: the future can be better than the present, and I have the ability to make it so.

## Surround yourself with like minded people

A lot of things also come down to identity, right? Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs and you want to let a few things into your identity as possible if you want to be able to think as clearly as possible. Therefore 

## Get outside at least 20 mins a day

Creativity is sparked by adventure. 

## Read on a topic that interest you that you don’t know much about

## If you have the time and resources get a pet

## Drastically reduce your time on social media



## Quit comparing yourself to others

## If you are in a toxic, abusive relationship, leave

## Starting changing slowly, take baby steps. Slow but steady progress

## Quit trying to find love, do the above and love will find you

The goose chase for love is crazy and never ending.
