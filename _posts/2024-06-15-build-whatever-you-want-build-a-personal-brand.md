Last week I wrote to you to build whatever you want.

You might ask, "But Patrick, i don't know what to build."

Okay I heard you. 

Let's start with your personal brand.

I am going to give you a blueprint you can use to build a personal brand that is going to to be the key to unlock many areas of your life for you.

Without a personal brand (digital avatar or high value social media profile) you close yourself off to global opportunities.  

If you have a strong online or digital blueprint : 
  
 - You can learn skills that schools can’t teach you.  
- You can make acquaintances that will play a pivotal role in your life.  
- You can make income that isn’t limited by a salary.  

We aren't digging goldmines and coalmines like the 70's. 
The masters of today hunt for ideas and information.

In the digital economy, a personal brand is not a second option.

Society continues to define what values is in every generation. 

Our ancestors dug deep down to the heart of mother earth for value. They traded gold, diamonds, ore and other minerals as exchange for value.

Masters of the industrial age were those who had huge machinery. 

Wealth and riches which essentially leads to a good life was centralized among corporations.

The Internet and social media has diversified wealth creation.

I used to hate social media but honestly, it's now part and parcel of my success. 

I got my first 'real' job when I posted the certificate I had completing my 6 month upskilling program.

Social media is how you get a job without a job board, sell a book without a publisher, and make music without a record deal. 

Many people hear this and think it is impossible when all they do is scroll and consume all day, post random memes and argue with faces they don't recognize online.

They are not consistent and have no strategy but complain when they don't see results.

### The big picture 

Everyone has a digital avatar, whether you know it or not. 

If you have a social media account like Facebook, Twitter (X), Whatsapp or LinkedIn.

It is your duty to build that avatar to represent who you are online. Like the avatar you build in a video game.

At the basic level you have few upgrades. But as you progress you have access to more upgrades (resources ) to improve your performance (impact).

When you get to higher levels you win more and get what you want faster.

Social media facilitate exchange of value without the limit to location and time. You have to be within that environment to benefit from this.

Nobody knows you.

You have to make people aware of you.

The easiest path is to build a digital avatar of you. A social media profile that can hold your physical character and value in the digital space.

### Start from here 

Create a Facebook account.

Pick a social platform that doesn't require you to know much technical skills, picture editing, video editing etc. 


Facebook is a text based platform with a huge user base so it is easier to grow on it.

As you establish your presence, you can diversify your reach to other platforms by directing your followers there.

So I recommend you create a Facebook account and start writing about:

- your story.
- your skills.
- your beliefs.
- your passion.
- your highs and lows.
- your mistakes and lessons.
- your ideas and observations.

Creating content on social media is truly the simplest and most affordable way to market yourself in today's internet age. 

Next week we can go deeper on how to grow your account. 

But first make I want to make sure you have an account on either Twitter or Facebook we can work with.

If you already have an account great.

Do a little bit of tidying up on your profile:

- get a quality headshot profile picture 
- use Canva or Microsoft designer to get a simple banner
- create a concise headline about what you offer. Pick 3 to 4 topics you genuinely care about. I love talking about business, productivity, self mastery and branding.
- read books on these topics. Broaden your knowledge base, take notes so you can blend that with your personality.

Social media is a big business. 

The apps on your phone are gateway to freedom. Don’t sleep on it.

Everything you need to write and post on social media has been Simplified in my [Value Creator Writing Playbook](https://nas.io/skillembassy/tusf)

One high income skill you must learn this year is: 

- how to be confident and comfortable sharing your story out there.
- how to create and distribute value by learning and building on the internet.

Your skill set isn’t valuable if nobody knows about it. 

### The Internet is a multiplier 

Most people still perceive social media as an “app on their phone.” And yet they spend much-too-large portion of their life on it.

I want you to develop mindset about it.

Once you see social media for what it is, a new world opens up.

- You can learn skills that schools can’t teach you.  
- You can make acquaintances that will play a pivotal role in your life.  
- You can make income that isn’t limited by a salary

I quit Facebook for a month, created a new [account](https://facebook.com/patrickkyei) and used it to STUDY the platform.  

I did a lot of experimenting. If I want to grow very fast, I know what growth strategy to execute. 

Play the long game. Slow, study and consistent.

Social media is a skill, not random luck.

People always think it’s about luck or magic when they haven’t spent even one hour studying the skill.

They scroll mindlessly, envying the success of others, assuming it's all chance.

But behind every viral post, every engaging story, there's strategy, consistency, and a deep understanding of the platform.

It’s about:

- Knowing your audience.
- Crafting compelling content.
- Timing your posts for maximum impact.
- Engaging with followers authentically.

Those who succeed on social media have put in the hours.

They’ve studied trends, analyzed data, and continuously refined their approach.

Luck might give you a moment in the spotlight.

But skill keeps you there.

If you’re serious about leveraging social media, stop waiting for a miracle.

If I am a business owner I’d rather have a 100K audience, with 10K of those being my target audience, than only a 10K audience of my target. More leverage, reach, and opportunity. It's a numbers game.

But you stack the deck in your favor by building competence. Because competence converts.

Start investing time into learning the craft.

Your followers, engagement, and success will grow as a direct result.
