## 1. Everything Is Temporary

Everything in life is temporary. Beauty, money , happiness and everything is temporary. No matter how much we want something to last forever, it will eventually end.

## 2. Remember To Enjoy Life

This piece of advice sounds very simple, but most of us truly need to be reminded to enjoy our lives.

## 3. Stop Complaining

So many people complain about small everyday things. They might complain about the weather, traffic, or the quality of the meal that they ate last night.

## 4. Live Without Fear

It’s useless to be afraid of things and to let them hold us back from doing what we want to do. Most of the time, fear is in our minds.

## 5. Family Matters More Than Friends

When we are young, our friends mean the world to us. We would rather ditch family dinner in favor of spending a Friday night out. But at the end of the day, your family are the ones who love you unconditionally. Friends come and go when we graduate school, switch jobs, and break up with boyfriends and girlfriends. But your family is forever with you.

## 6. Money Can’t Buy Happiness

“Money can’t buy happiness” is an old phrase that you have probably heard before. Money can help with a lot of things in life. There are plenty of problems that would be solved if you only had enough money to throw at the issue. However, money cannot buy love. And love is happiness.

## 7. Don’t Try to Change Other People

In the United States, 50% of marriages end in divorce

They hoped that someday they would grow out of bad or immature behavior. Others believed that with enough love, they can actually change or “fix” the issues that their partner has.

## 8. Treat Yourself With Love and Respect

If you are being treated badly by the people around you, remind yourself that it is because they already have this preconceived notion in their mind of who you are.

## 9. A Lifetime Is Not Really That Long

Last, and certainly not least, is that life is unfortunately not as long as we think it is. When you consider that we sleep at least eight hours per night, we are at work eight hours a day, and you may also be commuting, this leaves very little time to actually be our true selves. And as we get older, time seems to go by much faster.

## 10. Say What You Mean to Say

Sometimes , people don't understand what we want to say . Then, they think that we are bad . But actually we are not .

We should be ready to tell everything clearly.
