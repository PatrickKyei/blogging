You're on the correct track if you're thinking about your relationships far before anyone else. Most people between the ages of 16 and 25 aren't thinking about who they spend time with, how often they reach out, or how they may actively go deeper in their relationships.

I certainly wasn't. They, like most young adults, are simply reverting to their existing ties, settling for people and goals that present themselves rather than seeking out the ones they truly desire. That's fine; we all go through it. That was a phase I went through; it's just a part of growing up.

But you have to adjust the game today if you want to get ahead. You must be careful in who you connect with and spend time with, and you must take seriously those whom you allow into your social zone.

So, here's my advice: Stay in touch with people. Don't completely give up on them. However, be patient as individuals in your friend zone catch up. They haven't yet realized the value of great relationships.

By the way, this isn't only a teen issue. There are people in their 40s and 50s who don't realize how critical these issues are. You'll always come across people who don't appreciate the importance of connections. So, while maintaining your relationships, give priority to those who return your investment. Follow the good vibes; if 9 out of 10 people your age don't engage, but one of them does and you sense a connection, it's a victory; stick with that person.

A few close and meaningful relationships are always better to a hundred weak ones. And, if I were you, I'd start paying attention to those who are older than me. Older, wiser individuals who get it enjoy hearing from young people like you who are curious and hardworking.

For the next 5 to 10 years, you might have more luck with older people, which is a huge benefit when it comes time to hunt for a career, start a project, arrange a fun trip, or whatever; those individuals will be clutch, and you have a lot to offer them as well.

If you're reading this, it's not too late to get serious about your relationships. It doesn't matter if you're 16, 26, or 36 years old. It's never too early or too late to start. Simply begin. It's that easy.
