When the world comes crashing down,  
And all seems lost and grim,  
I'll take a moment to reflect,  
On all the love that's within.

For in the chaos and the noise,  
There's one thing that remains true,  
That when the world comes down,  
I'll be thinking of you.

With every breath I take,  
I'll whisper your name,  
For in my heart and in my soul,  
You'll always hold a flame.

Even in the darkest hours,  
When all hope seems to fade,  
I'll hold on to the thought of you,  
And find the strength to wade.

Through every storm and every struggle,  
I'll keep you close in mind,  
For when the world comes down,  
You'll be the one I find.

So when the skies are grey,  
And the winds are blowing strong,  
Just know that in my heart,  
Our love will always belong.

For when the world comes down,  
I'll be thinking of you,  
And in that thought,  
I'll find the strength,  
To make it through.
