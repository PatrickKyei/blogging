It's a long time I wrote anything at all. But after pondering about life and what meaning is to each of us and how we can achieve that with **gratitude**, I put my writing cap on, so where we go..

At some point in our lives, we realize that material possessions can only bring us temporary happiness. No matter how much we accumulate, there will always be someone who has more. 

It is only when we shift our focus from what we have to what we can create that we truly start living. It's about making the most of the resources we have been blessed with and using them to create a life full of purpose and meaning.

It's not always easy, especially in a world that constantly bombards us with messages of consumerism and the importance of owning the latest and greatest. 

But when we stop comparing ourselves to others and start focusing on our own unique journey, we can experience a sense of freedom and joy that can't be found in material possessions.

> Living a fulfilling life isn't about having everything, it's about making the most of what we have and finding joy in the little things. 

It's about creating meaningful experiences and building deep connections with the people around us. It's about living a life that aligns with our values and brings us a sense of purpose.

So, let's embrace what we have been given and use it to create a life full of passion, love, and fulfillment. 

Let's stop chasing after the things we don't have and start cherishing the things that we do. Because in the end, it's not about how much we have, it's about how much we can give and how much love we can share.
