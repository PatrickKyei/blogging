How quickly and slowly love come and goes nobody know.  
How deeply love can cut and hurt nobody knows.

The loneliness I felt and the lies I was told nobody knows.  
I could only keep a short smile  
Because even when I tried to smile more  
It hurts the deeper.  
Nobody knows.

How I longed to be happy in someone else's arms  
How I wanted to be in someone else's thought  
Nobody knows.
