When you do something good and are proud of it, it's important to take a moment to savor the feeling and the accomplishment. This can help you appreciate and recognize your own abilities and strengths, and it can also serve as motivation to continue working hard and striving for success. It's important to celebrate your achievements, no matter how big or small, as this can boost your confidence and self-esteem. So, when you do something good and are proud of it, allow yourself to fully experience and enjoy the feeling of accomplishment.  

> When you do something good, something you are proud of, allow yourself to savor it.

This can be a simple as taking a few deep breaths and reflecting on what you did and why it was meaningful to you, or it can be as elaborate as treating yourself to something special or sharing your accomplishment with others. The key is to take a moment to acknowledge and appreciate your own hard work and success.
