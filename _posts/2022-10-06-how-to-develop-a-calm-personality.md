I'm going to tell you what I have done and the traits I have worked on to enhance my calm confidence.

## 1. Deal with my problems.

I no longer let problems sit within me. I am dealing with all of them and from now on will do so as they arrive. Any stresses in your life will affect your calm confidence. Don't let them linger.

## 2. Don't complain about bad luck. 

For me it is about taking the rough with the smooth. Life is full of ups and downs, nothing can change that. You can sit and complain or you can deal with them.

3. ## Don't allow others to bring you down.

This is a big one. Other people will always be there to try and kick you down. Either intentionally or unintentionally. I simply let it wash over me. I'm not saying it's as simple as just letting it go. This may be one of the last parts you develop. As you find your calm confidence, you will find it easier to cope with the dramas other people are responsible for.

## 4. Keep your mind active.

Especially when you're low. You cannot escape periods of low mood. Everyone is affected by something at some point. But rather than become lazy from it and obsess over it, do something you enjoy to forget your problems. No matter how much you would rather not. Just make yourself do something different.

## 5. Give yourself credit for what you achieve. 

When you do something good, something you are proud of, allow yourself to savor it. There is nothing wrong with doing that.
Give yourself a chance to recharge; They say all work and no play makes you a dull person. Give yourself some time to relax when you've been doing so much. Go on holiday or just take some time to enjoy having a short break away from the stresses of life. Your brain will thank you for it.

## 6. Be grateful for what you have.

Your life will never be perfect. Don't brood over what you don't have. Be grateful for what you do. It will make you a much happier person.
