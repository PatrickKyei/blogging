## Comparing yourself to others

> Comparison destroys character.

Stop comparing yourself to people who started ten years ago before you. Focus own your joureny.

There's nothing wrong if you have to draw inspiration from the journey of those successfull people in your life. But do not bug your thoughts around why they are doing better than you or have what you don't have. Focus on improving yourself and becoming better instead.

Joy comes from advancement, not comparison.

## Arguing with others

You might win the argument, but you won’t change their mind, so what’s the point.

## Negative news (which is mostly all news)

Unless you’re going to do something about it, you’re only polluting your mind. And if you share the news with others, you’re polluting theirs too.

## People who like to complain, blame, condemn, and criticize

## Procrastination

It only leads to misery. But if you act, you shine. And if you act consistently, you’ll be unstoppable.

## Doubting yourself

Self doubt kills more dreams than failure does.

> You need to stop the habit of doubting yourself.

Whatever you want do, if it is worth pursuing, start now.

Start where you are. Start with fear. Start with doubt. Start with hands shaking. Start with voice trembling, but start.

If you do, you’ll attract reasons to support your claims.

You have what it takes, don't ever doubt.

> Imagine what's possible once you stop doubting yourself.

## Settling for Less

> All limitations are self imposed.

The only limits in your life are the ones you put on yourself, so dream big, and be bold.

Create the life you wish to have and deserve. **I'm not talking about being reckless**. I'm asking you to LIVE abundantly, know your worth and Love your life. Don't waste it by liveing less than what you were meant for.

> There is no passion to be found in settling for a life less than the one you are capable of living. - Nelson Mandela
