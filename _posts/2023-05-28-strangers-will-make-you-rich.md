Learning how to network is probably the most life-changing experience I've ever had and I also want to challenge you to think that networking is a skill that you can learn.

> Networking is not dependent on the personality of yourself.

**I understand that many early career starters are grappling with a common dilemma these days. The field you love barely sustains you. I think it's sad that something that you are so passionate about and is supposed to put food on the table for you doesn't cut it. But here we are. This is the reality, and you have to be increasingly clever to succeed at all.**


- First off, you sound like a really talented, very passionate, driven person. You've got real connection to this work. You sound awesome. 


- Secondly, I want to reassure you that the mini-crisis you're currently experiencing is entirely normal. It often occurs around the age of 25, known as the quarter-life crisis, when many individuals undergo a significant period of self-reflection and exploration. If you are considering a career change, further education, or exploring different side jobs, it's important to remember that there is no failure in doing so. In fact, this is the perfect time for such exploration and self-discovery.


- Thirdly, while pursuing meaningful work is crucial, we cannot disregard the importance of financial stability. Money plays a significant role in allowing us to live fuller lives, whether it's moving out of your mom's basement, traveling, or simply relieving financial stress. It is entirely acceptable to pursue more lucrative opportunities that align with your financial goals.

### Tips And Tricks

Now, let me provide you with some direct advice. 


One of the best steps you can take right now is to reach out and build relationships with people in your field and those exploring similar paths. By learning from others who are in entry-level positions, you can gain valuable insights into how they make their chosen profession work. 


Understand their work style, whether they balance a day job with freelancing on weekends, set boundaries to pursue personal projects, teach on the side, or transition from smaller to larger markets. Explore if anyone has made the move you are considering, temporarily stepping away and then reentering the field.


These are the questions you should be asking yourself right now. Embrace a student mindset, seeking knowledge on how to succeed in your profession or transition to another that utilizes similar skills. 

### The Value In Relationships

Building relationships will not only provide you with valuable insights but also change the way you approach the job-hunting game. Instead of the traditional approach of sending out countless resumes and hoping for callbacks, invest your energy in forging new connections and leveraging existing ones within your network. 


Opportunities often arise through personal connections, referrals, or strong impressions made during professional events.

### Leverage On Your Own Experience

Remember, you are in a unique position to build these relationships effectively. Your past experiences, adventures, and stories are precious assets when it comes to developing connections. Reach out to people in your field, express your passion, highlight mutual connections, and share relevant articles or resources. Approach this with genuine curiosity and generosity, for the best things in life often come through meaningful relationships.


This is not just a mere life hack; it's a fundamental shift in how you perceive the world and the value of relationships. Trust me when I say that the most remarkable experiences in your life will emerge from these connections. Lean into this process, be patient, and remain curious. 


A> ll the seeds you plant today will undoubtedly bear fruit in the future. In the meantime, consider utilizing your rent-free life to subsidize the next phase of your life. Whatever you do, don't wait—jump in. 


The rest of your life awaits, and now is the perfect time to seize it. I am genuinely excited for you and wish you the best of luck on this incredible journey.


Stay a champ✊
