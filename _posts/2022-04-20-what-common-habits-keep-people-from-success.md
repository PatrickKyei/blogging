## No willpower

Many people aspire to be successful, yet lack the motivation to pursue their goals. Willpower is the inner strength that allows you to not only choose but also follow through on your decisions.

Wishes are fine to have; they stimulate your mind and instill a desire in your heart. But nothing gets accomplished until those aspirations are pursued. To be able to live the life one has always desired, one must develop the ability to pursue one's dreams.

## Instant gratification Vs Delayed gratification

So many people are incapable of enduring even minor discomfort in order to pursue their own particular goals on this planet. They prefer chasing short-term goals to pursuing long-term ambitions. Unfortunately, success isn't something that can be achieved in a single day. It takes perseverance and hard work.

And the reason you haven't accomplished anything significant is that you simply want to live the fantasy of today. You must develop the habit of viewing your life as a series of steps leading to success. To achieve your goal, you must be willing to take those steps one at a time.

## Fear

On the other side of fear is everything you desire. Many people lack the confidence to follow through on their commitments that will lead to success. Many dreams have died as a result of fear.

Growth requires the bravery to start, to navigate lonely roads, and to embark on unpredictable journeys. We don't grow by doing solely what makes us feel good all of the time. We develop through taking on difficult tasks that we are committed to overcome.

> Face your fears.

## Goal

Choosing the unsuitable or unrealistic objective will almost always end in failure, preventing you from achieving your goals. As a result, only SMART goals should be pursued. **SMART** goals are :

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chieveable
- **R**ealistic
- **T**ime-bound 

## Focus

Your focus is the unseen force behind excellence. Being at the right place at the right time and doing the right thing is what leads to personal development and achievement.

It's inevitable that you'll stray from your route at some time in your life. It's fine if you need to swiftly investigate and test new fields, or if you've simply grown overwhelmed by the world and need to take a break. However, you have to always find your way back to why you started all of this.

You need to keep your head up on the road you have chosen for yourself and don't stop until you get there.

> Don't forget why you started.

You just do not dream about success, you need to work hard for it.
