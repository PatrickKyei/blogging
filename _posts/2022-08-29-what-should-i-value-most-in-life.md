- **Health:** Without it no other value will ever matter. If you have good health there are so many that would exchange whatever money they have for it. Take care of yours.

- **Today:** You’ve got another chance to make things right. Another chance to try and better yourself. And a stern reminder today is today and tomorrow is never a guarantee.

- **Family:** Yes, some have toxic families. All families have their issues. If you have a somewhat functionally sane family, be thankful. There are many that have none.

- **Friend:** That one or two good friends you can count on in good times and bad. Not “acquaintances.” So many confuse the two. Hard to find a true long term friend.

- **Partner:** A trusting, aware, loving, loyal and creative partner. One who challenges you to be a better you and doesn’t challenge your sanity with lies and manipulation. They are hard to come by.

- **Awareness:** If you are one of the few that posses this powerful trait, use it to your advantage. Not only educating others, but to become more self-aware of yourself and seek the wisdom that comes with it.

- **Opinion:** Take great value in them, learn from them and separate what is fact and fiction and grow from it. But don’t take them personally.

- **Simplicity:** The human can complicate life when it doesn’t need to be complicating.

Remember, there are many things to be grateful in your life. And what you take for granted there is someone out there is praying for.
