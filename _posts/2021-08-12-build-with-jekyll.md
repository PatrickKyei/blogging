## Paragraph

I wandered lonely as a cloud

That floats on high o'er vales and hills,

When all at once I saw a crowd,

A host, of golden daffodils;

Beside the lake, beneath the trees,

Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

## Mathematics

The mathematics powered by [**MathJax**](https://www.mathjax.org/):

$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^2 = \frac{\pi^2}{6} $$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ and they are

$$ x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a} $$
