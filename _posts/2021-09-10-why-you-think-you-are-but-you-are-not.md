People think they see things as they are.
> 
> There's a group of people who I think are somewhat self-aware who do agree that "Indeed, I'm sure I'm wrong about some things. I'm sure I have some biases," because everyone does.

We think we see things to be what they are. Also, I regularly see this contention on the web. In case somebody's arguing on Twitter, "I'm simply disclosing to you current realities." And it resembles, all things considered, they have their inclination and your political conviction and afterward a strict teaching, and some arrangement of realities that they sort of have misconstrued. Furthermore, one may say, "I'm simply mentioning to you what's directly before the entirety of our eyes," and it's rarely the equivalent. You know, we can get as philosophical as we need concerning how our brains construct reality, but at the end of the day, nobody really seems to see things how they are. All we can do is get close, right?

## Hold Your Identity Lightly

Try to hold your identity more lightly, try to maintain a little bit more emotional distance from your beliefs. Thus you can in any case call yourself, you know, whatever you are, yet attempt to hold that all the more softly. So that involves things like reminding yourself that label is contingent. So indeed, you are whatever you call yourself right now because that label describes your beliefs, but if you were to conclude that belief is wrong or harmful, then you would not hold those beliefs anymore.
So essentially, you're trying to make the label feel like just a label and not like a flag that you're waving or a badge that you're wearing.

There's a category of people who I believe are somewhat more mindful who might somehow agree and say "Indeed, I'm certain I'm biased with regards to certain things, I'm certain I have a few inclinations," since everybody does. Yet, there will never be a second where they're similar to, "Gracious, indeed, this is a thing that I may be wrong about."

At the point when you're wrong or when you're biased, it never really feels like you are in the moment. **So it takes some true sort of confidence** in the external view that like, even though it seems like I'm most certainly right, there is some possibility that I'm not because everybody's biased with regards to bunches of things and I've been biased in the past. Thus you need to sort of do that theoretical jump in your mind to override your certainty that for this situation you're most certainly right.

## Why We Misunderstand Arguments As People

How we misunderstand arguments is that our brains sort of match them with arguments that we've heard before. So it's so difficult to learn from misunderstanding with people with various perspectives from you, because I think we sort of anticipate that it should be simpler than it is.

By which, I mean, we will, in general, have this implicit assumption that well, assuming people are being sensible and arguing with the best of intentions, it ought to be clear who's right, and that person should change their perspective. Thus assuming that doesn't occur, you get disappointed and you feel like, "Well, these people are being unreasonable and they're stubborn and close-minded," and you sort of discount them. That assumption kind of backfires and does make it harder for you to learn from disagreements because you end up thinking that everyone is being stubborn and close-minded.  

## Is My Mindset Tied To My Identity?

A lot of things additionally boil down to identity, right? Our identity is often wrapped up in beliefs. So the most natural instances of beliefs that become part of our identity are our politics and religion. Being a liberal or traditionalist, or libertarian, or a nonbeliever or a Baptist. Those beliefs are part of our identities in the sense that we feel proud to be a skeptic or a Baptist or a liberal, and so on. You know, we take it personally when someone disagrees and it becomes much more quickly an attack on us as a person, as opposed to an attack on something we happen to believe. Thus this is the reason there is the normal decorum rule to not raise politics and religion at a social gathering or on a date.

> All things equal, you want to let a few things into your identity as possible, if you need to have the option to think as clearly as could be expected. 

I will attempt to try not to label myself in any way, with the goal that I don't distort my thinking. So I will keep away from political labels. I will try not to consider myself a vegan or a skeptic." And the issue is only that this isn't strategically doable. Like names are helpful to have the option to simply portray your beliefs and your decisions. What's more, just inwardly, it's presumably not sensible to dispose of all sensations of connection to your convictions about things like politics.

## What Can I Do Instead?

So what you can try to do now instead is to just try to hold your identity more lightly, attempting to keep somewhat a little bit more emotional distance from your beliefs. Thus you can in any case call yourself, you know, a skeptic or anything you desire, however, attempt to hold that all the more gently. So that involves things like reminding yourself that label is contingent. So yes, I'm a religious activist because that label just best describes my beliefs. But if I were to conclude that activism is wrong or harmful, then I would not be an activist anymore. So essentially you're trying to make the label feel like just the label and not like a flag that you're waving or a badge that you're wearing.

## What You Want To Consider

All things considered, I mean, it's additionally for all intents and purposes if you would like to persuade anybody that they're wrong, it's simply an awful strategic choice to make your case in a very self-righteous and self-congratulatory way, because regardless of whether you are correct, regardless of whether you do have valid justifications for holding your belief, assuming you say it simply in a tone dribbling with loftiness, you're not going to change anyone's mind. No doubt I believe that is another — people often worry that like, "Well, you have to hold your belief strongly, or you'll never change the world. You'll never prevail upon hearts and minds," however practically speaking, more often than not, holding your beliefs strongly tied to your identity makes you worse at effecting change because it makes people not want to listen to you.
