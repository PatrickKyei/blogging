## Introduction

> I'm often excited about learning new things and exploring areas of learning that tinker my curiosity.

I can still remember my early years when I had the passion of becoming an IT Man(when we didn't even have the different roles in the Tech field). It was just a dream back then because I didn't have a computer at home or of my own. I could still remember anytime we went to the ICT lab I was very excited and always performed very well on the tasks we were given and even had my colleagues calling me to help them.

I weekends, I would run to Eric's house(Eric was many years older than me) and spend almost the whole day at his family house because they had this DELL desktop I could use.

I started doing troubling-shooting for them in those days without me even knowing that is what I was doing(installed softwares, updated the OS, unintalling unecessary applications when the computer performed slowly).

Fast forward, I could get my personal laptop that I used to learn so many things related to Information Technology(from learning foundational programming, graphic design, excel tasks) and I fortunately came across the scholarship from Commonwealth of Learning. Getting the scholarship and knowing the IT Support program was part was an excitement. 

Thanks to the scholarship issuers, they are empowering many people with the skills and confidence towards a career they have always dreamt about.
