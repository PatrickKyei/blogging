## Introduction

> I'm often excited about learning new things and exploring areas of learning that pique my curiosity.

Even though we didn't even know about the many professions in the tech area at the time, I can still clearly recall my early years when I was passionate about being an IT person. 

Because I didn't have a computer at home or on my own at the time, it was just a dream. I still have vivid memories of how happy I was whenever we went to the ICT lab. I always did well on the assignments assigned to us, and occasionally my friends would call me for assistance.

I used to spend virtually the entire day at Eric's family's home on the weekends since they had this DELL desktop I could use. Eric was several years older than I was.  
In those days, I began conducting trouble-shooting for them without even being aware of what I was doing (installed softwares, updated the OS, uninstalling uneccessary applications when the computer performed slowly).

Then, I was able to purchase my own laptop, which I utilized to learn a variety of IT-related skills (including basic programming, graphic design, and Excel operations), and I was fortunate to find the Commonwealth of Learning scholarship. It was exciting to receive the scholarship and learn that the IT Support program was covered by it.

Thanks to the scholarship sponsors, many people now have the confidence and knowledge necessary to pursue the careers they've always wanted.
