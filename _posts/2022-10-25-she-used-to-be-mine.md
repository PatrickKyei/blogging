_brown skin girl_

She used to be mine, that girl with the smile  
The one who could light up my world for a while  
She used to be mine, the one I held dear  
The one who I loved with all that I had here

She used to be mine, the one I'd call my own  
The one I'd cherish, the one I'd never let go  
She used to be mine, the one I'd hold tight  
The one I'd protect with all of my might

But now she's gone, and I'm left behind  
With nothing but memories, love that's confined        
She used to be mine, but now she's free  
And all that's left is a love that used to be

I'll remember her laughter, her touch, her grace  
And all the moments we shared in this place  
She used to be mine, but now she's a part  
Of a love that's over, a chapter that's closed in my heart

But even though she's gone, I'll always be glad  
To have loved her, and to have had  
The memories of our love, will stay with me  
Forever, in my mind, she used to be mine.

**She used to be mine.**
