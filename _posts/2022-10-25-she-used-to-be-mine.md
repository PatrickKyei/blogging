Something in the way you say my name tells me you are not coming back.  

She has a special voice  
It's the first thing I wanted to hear each day.

Her smile is unique  
One that can bring a grin to a sad person's face.

Her presence was like the sunshine coming over the highlands from the opposite direction.

She was all mine.  
I used to walk down the alley holding her hands.

Well I do know, she had the power to inspire in me the belief that I was capable of anything.

**She used to be mine.**
