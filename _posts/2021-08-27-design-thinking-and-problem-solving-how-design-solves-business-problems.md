It was a simple idea. But it exploded.

> Fall in love with the problem and not the solution.

A new Dutch bicycle company Vanmoof reported that one straightforward design improvement resulted in an 80% reduction in delivery damages.

They started sending bikes to the USA in 2015. The only problem was that a lot of them were arriving to their customers damaged.

It was annoying for the customers and expensive for the company to fix.

To prevent negligent couriers from destroying their delivery, they designed their packaging resemble that of a TV.

Result - 80% drop in damages!

A good example of using design thinking to solve a business problem.

They shared the history of their "TV" box in an incredible blog post.
