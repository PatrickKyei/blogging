Anything that you optimize makes maximum use of available resources.

Memory and space have a finite lifespan.

The engineers of this world knows this. Under the hood of any device you use is a process that ensures space is optimized for important tasks.

Nature has its own way of creating space for important life activities.

If humans congest space out of a settlement, they are likely to face more natural disasters that will displace them to create room for space for life to thrive.

Typical example is when your phone or laptop begins to run slow. You manually clear cache to create space for optimal efficiency.

Your brain is the center of your productive work. Your Life.
Your life's work should be your no.1 goal.

What you'll spend most of your time on is improving your life to achieve happiness.

All of the inter-working processes you will go through to achieve this is going to be determined by your brain.

The brain, the most complicated object in the universe, requires just 20 watts of power. To simulate your brain, a computer the size of a city block would need to be powered by a nuclear power plant, yet your brain only needs 20 watts. — Michio Kaku

You have the world’s most powerful super computer in your head.

You can improve your life if you improve your brain.

The problems is that most people have old mental software.

You need to update your mental software from “Get a job and do that for the rest of my life” as a default setting to:

- Get a job
- start a personal project
- turn that project into a business
- make enough money, leave my job
- and focus on scaling my side hustle as the new path

You see, everyone needs money.

The easiest way? Get a job.

And 9-5 jobs aren’t bad.

I worked for years as an employee to gain skills.

I learned persuasion, sales, human psychology, communication and collaboration.

However, it’s not optimal.

You might be earning a profit, but:

You’re not following your purpose by working a job you hate.  
You’re not free if your boss calls you at night, telling you to show up tomorrow on your day off. If you say no, you lose your job.  
You don’t have time to enjoy life.  
Spend time with family because you’re required to work like an animal.

You start smoking cigarettes or drinking alcohol to “get rid of” the stress.


### OPEN YOUR MIND TO INFORMATION

During the past 2 days my computer had been having glitches due to low storage capacity.

![pc self upgrade](/assets/img/update.png)

Shockingly the system upgraded itself, removed certain folders and files for it to run smoothly.

To me this was painful. But it was a necessary requirement for the system to run efficiently.

Up until you turned 18 years you have been conditioned to think and live a certain way by parents, teachers, friends and whatever.

You were sold the safe path:
- go to college
- get good grades
- find a decent job
- retire at 60 and wait for death

So what you choose to spend the rest of your life on has been limited by society. You were sold an illusion by parents and teachers who were sold an illusion.

People are starting to wake up to the fact that the conventional path doesn't work for smart people.

The internet has made it possible to monetize the knowledge in your head. People who know how to learn, build, and distribute information will thrive.

If you are reading to this point I assume you are smart to notice this.


### LEVERAGE THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE

If you don’t know what you want, understand what you don’t want and work in the opposite direction.

It is easy to observe what you don’t want and reverse engineer your path .

Set a 10 years goals. Break it down into stage and work it back.

What you want in 10 years, 5 years, 1 year, 6 months, weeks, days to achieve those goals.

We are in an information age — there is information and an abundance of ideas circulating our world.

People are losing trust in externally assigned hierarchies of goals whether it be from corporate culture, organized religions, or formal education.

Because of this, you must play an active role in constructing your life. This requires personal responsibility, massive self-belief, and the realization that your life's work if your no.1 goal, not work assigned to you.

### FILTER THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO YOU

Not all information available to you will be useful to achieve your goals.

Filter every information through your 10 year vision.

Say “no” to everything except for that which aligns with the new person you want to become.

Start optimizing the buggy mental conditioning of your mind through conscious choice.

Everybody has heard of James Clear’s “One Percent Better Everyday” mantra.

It holds a lot of power.


If you're continually feeling like you're not enough, stop following social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.

If you're wasting too much time watching television, move the TV out of the bedroom.

If you're spending too much money on electronics, quit reading reviews of the latest tech gear.

If you're spending too much time on video games, unplug the console and put it in a closet after each use.

If you can't seem to get any work done, leave your phone in another room for a few hours.

It took 18+ years to condition you to the point you are now.

Don’t expect much progress overnight.

Surround yourself with people who inspire you to think bigger, aim higher and relentlessly go after it.

Self-educate to expand awareness and uncover new paths.

Hypothesize and experiment with solutions that will solve your problems.

Most people allow their life to simply happen to them. They float along. They wait. They react. And by the time a large portion of their life is behind them, they realize they should have been more proactive and strategic.

I hope that hasn't been true for you. If it has, then I want to encourage you to adopt the new path and leave the conventional path. It served it's purpose, it will no longer serve you.

### OPTIMIZE YOUR LIFE FOR THE NEW PATH

#### Build a personal brand

To make any kind of money in today’s internet world, you must deliver substantial value, build a brand that people trust and associate who you are becoming with.

Why are most digital products not making the profit?

Why are most service businesses not succeeding?

It’s because they lack a strong brand behind them.

There’s no trust, connection, and empathy.

If you’re unsure where to begin or need ideas on how to start building your personal brand I teach this in the [7 Days Business Challenge](https://nas.io/undefined/challenges/7-days-business-challenge)

#### Find a Niche

When you have a skill, you need to identify a niche to apply it to.

Fitness coaches?

Real estate agents?

Software companies?

Cleaning businesses?

Determine who your service is for.

Alternatively, you can choose the second option, which I did, and go broad.

If you’re planning to write sales copy (become a copywriter), I would suggest finding a targeted niche.

If you have any questions, you can always send me a DM or reply to this mail. I’ll be happy to help.

#### Post Valuable Contents Daily
Your focus now should just be on building your brand and learning the skill you’ve picked.

If it’s copywriting, practice the skill by writing content daily.

If it’s video editing, practice the skill by editing and uploading videos daily.

You won’t gain high-quality followers by posting low-quality content that doesn’t add value to people’s lives.

If you can create at least 10 quality posts every single day for 6 months, it will be impossible for people to ignore you!

#### Create an Offer
You need 3 things to build an offer:

1. Messaging.

Use these 4 commandments:

Quantifiable   
Time Frame   
Targeted   
Risk Reversal   
Example 1: I help fitness coaches (targeted) gain 1,000 followers (quantifiable) in 30 days (time frame) or I work for free (risk reversal).

Example 2: I help cleaning businesses (targeted) increase their website traffic by 15% (quantifiable) in 45 days (time frame) or you get 50% of your money back. (risk reversal)

2. Deliverables. Examples:

I will write 60 posts a month.   
I will redesign your website and write 4 blogs a month.   
3. Pricing. I can’t tell you exactly how much you should price your services because it all depends. Depending on your niche and skill, check some other freelancers on social media or on platforms like Upwork or Fiverr to see how they price their services.


#### Use Yourself as a Case Study

The paradox of service businesses:

You need experience to win clients but you need clients to gain experience.

That’s key. You don’t need client work; you need sample work.

If you’re a video editor, upload videos with cool edits.  
If you’re a website designer, create 2-3 templates.   
If you’re a logo designer, create 5-10 logos.   
If you’re a ghostwriter, write posts daily.   
You are the case study.

Remember that.


#### Build a Lead Generation

Having a landing page or email list is crucial.

You can build a free email list with Convertkit or other similar software.

I personally use a website on my personal [domain](https://patrickkyei.com), but it’s more technical.

If you don’t want to spend any money, just use your social media page.

If you’re using Instagram, create highlights based on your offer, sample work, testimonials, etc.


#### Stay Consistent

While executing all the steps above, you must consistently post content.

Self-educate and practice your skills daily.  
Take this letter as a call-to-action.  
Don’t just read it and forget about it.  
Use it and implement each step accordingly.  

It will take time. Nothing good comes easy. However, making your first $1,000 depends on when you actually start working towards it.

A message I wanted to share:  
I urge you to shift your focus from trying to outperform 99% of people to outperforming yourself:

Your fears.  
Your doubts.  
Your bad habits.  
Your insecurities.  
Your limiting beliefs.  
Comparing yourself to others will only hold you back from success.

Your focus should be on becoming the best version of yourself.

Optimize your mind, and you change your life.

Have a wonderful week friend.
